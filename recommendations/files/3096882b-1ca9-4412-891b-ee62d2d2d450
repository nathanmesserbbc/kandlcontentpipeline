The clip shows scenes of battle and civilian devastation in World War One and includes a shot of wounded survivors. It goes on to describe how the League of Nations was formed in an attempt to resolve international disputes peacefully, but how those hopes were dashed by its failure. 
 We hear part of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's 1939 radio broadcast telling people in Britain they were once again at war with Germany. World War Two, as the clip points out, was even more destructive, with air raids, genocide in the Nazi death camps and the atomic bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. When peace came, people felt relieved, as a witness explains, but also uncertain about the future. They wondered, 'Where do we go from here?' 
 We live in a global economy with different threats. There is less danger, perhaps, of a world war on the scale of 1914 or 1939 and most of us feel we live in a 'peaceful country'. Yet we face the dangers of terrorism and soldiers still risk their lives in wars and peace-keeping missions. Soldiers like British Army Staff Sergeant Olaf Schmid whose funeral is shown in the video. We see images of World War One recruits joining the army then coverage of protesters marching against the Iraq War. 
 The clip concludes with the question: 'Can war be avoided?'
