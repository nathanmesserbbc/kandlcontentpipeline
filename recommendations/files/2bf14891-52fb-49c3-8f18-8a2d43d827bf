 * Remembering Caroline 
 Caroline Harriet Haslett was born on 17 August 1895 in Worth, a village in Sussex. 
 She lived near Ashdown Forest and grew up loving flowers, trees and animals. The Haslett family had five children, though Caroline's older brother William died when he was just 3 years old. 
 Caroline's father was an engineer on the railway and from him Caroline learned to love machines and tools. She was usually happier playing with nuts and bolts than making dolls' clothes. 
 Was Caroline good at school?
 Caroline went to school in Haywards Heath, then a country town with 5,000 people. Because of a bad back, she had to rest most days to strengthen her spine. She loved reading but she still found it hard to keep up with schoolwork because she was away from school so often. Her teacher said, as she did not seem very clever, Caroline might leave school early but Caroline was not going to give up so easily.
 Why was housework so hard?
 Caroline's mother, like most women, worked hard all day long cleaning, washing, cooking, lighting fires and carrying in coal. There was a lot of housework and there were no machines to help. It made Caroline think that it was no wonder so many women got so tired and ill.
