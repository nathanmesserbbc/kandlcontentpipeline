 Boys read comics like 'The Boy's Own Paper', about daring lads tackling wild beasts in faraway lands. There were also jokes, puzzles, football reports and poems about doing your duty. 
 When war came, the comics quickly took sides and became filled with British pro-war propaganda. Titles like 'Dreadnought' and 'Penny War Weekly' were full of stories about British Tommies (a nickname for British soldiers) beating German soldiers. The British were always shown as kindly heroes, while the Germans were all made out to be cowards.
 There was a 'Girl's Own Paper' too, with advice on dress-making and cooking. A girl could read all about knitting, needlework and pressing flowers. She wouldn't find any adventures with lions in far-off lands!
 'The Rainbow' was gentler than the bloodthirsty war comics. It had cartoon strips about Georgie Giraffe and his animal friends. But even here, war was lurking. The picture paper 'Comic Fun' carried a story called 'The Grey Gas'. 
 Other jokey comic strips of the time showed a German submarine sunk by a cheerful whale and jolly British spies, Brimstone and Billy, destroying a secret German army of killer robots.
 Children of the 1900s were big readers. Some of their favourite books are still on the shelves today. Many have been made into TV shows or films.
