Deep down, I always wanted to be a poet. I love the musicality of the words, the rhythms, the rhymes, the sound of the language on the ear and the rolling of the words on the tongue. That's when the words really come alive for me.
 Ever since I was introduced to his poetry, I've had a great respect for Dylan Thomas. In the year of his centenary I challenged the Townhill community in his hometown of Swansea to write their own version of Under Milk Wood. I wanted to see if the group could be inspired to unleash their own creativity.
