 	 In the early 1900s, families went to funfairs or for a paddle at the beach as a treat. Once war began holidays were a thing of the past, though people on the home front did still find time for day trips now and then.
 In a time before TV or radio, many towns had a music hall, where audiences could join in with singers and see comedians, ventriloquists and conjurors. Stars like the singers Vesta Tilley and Harry Lauder, or the comedian Dan Leno, toured the country.
 Cheery wartime songs such as 'It's a Long Way to Tipperary', 'Pack Up Your Troubles' and 'Keep the Home Fires Burning' were big hits. Music halls were also used to stage fund-raising events to aid the war effort. Sometimes during these shows men were invited on to stage to enlist.
 Parents who thought the music halls were too rowdy sometimes took their children to the cinema instead. 
 Motion picture shows were new and some parents disapproved of these too. All the films were black-and-white and had no sound. A piano player sitting at the front of the cinema played suitable music, often making up tunes to fit with the action on the screen. 
 In bigger cinemas, there might be a whole orchestra, who would use musical instruments to add in sounds such as church bells, gunshots or galloping horses. As the musicians played, words popped up on the screen to explain important points in the story.
 At the cinema, the audience would also get the chance to see a newsreel. Newsreels gave the latest headlines about the war as well as events in Britain and the rest of the world.
