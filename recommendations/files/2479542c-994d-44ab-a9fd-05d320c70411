The Mughal Empire covered most of the Asian subcontinent from 1526 until its eventual decline in 1858. A new exhibition at the British Library gives insight into one of the world's great dynasties, its emperors and life at court.
 The exhibition, Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire, is the first to document the entire period through more than 200 manuscripts, objects and paintings. 
 The Mughal Empire was a period of great change, including a centralised government, religious tolerance, new systems of education and a revival of artistic and cultural traditions.
