 Before World War One people who could afford it enjoyed holidays, but during the war with every effort needed to win the war it became unpatriotic to take long holidays, though people still took day trips to the seaside or into the country if possible.
 One propaganda poster from 1915 encouraged families to visit the countryside with the message: 'Why bother about the Germans invading the country? Invade it yourself by underground and motor-bus.'

 On a Saturday morning, if their parents could afford it, children might go to the cinema for a few pence. Cinemas showed comedy films, serial stories and cartoons for children. 
 All the films were black and white and had no sound. A piano player made up music to suit each film.

 Saturday night was bath night, so everyone would be fresh and clean for church on Sunday. In the homes of poorer families, there was no indoor bathroom. Everyone bathed in the warmest room of the house, usually the kitchen. 
 Water was heated in a copper. There was a brick-built box underneath the copper, where a coal fire heated up the water. Hot water was carried in buckets to a little tin bath tub. A copper held about six bucketfuls of water. Each family member took a turn in the tub, using the same water! Afterwards, the cold dirty water had to be taken out, bucket by bucket, and poured down the outside drain.
 After church on Sunday mornings, most children went to Sunday school in the afternoon. It wasn't always Bible reading and hymn practice. Sunday schools also arranged picnics and outings, as well as sports and games.
