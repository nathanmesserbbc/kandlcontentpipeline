 Boys in the early 1900s wore short jackets. One popular style was the 'Norfolk jacket', which was made of tweed and had lots of pockets.
 Under his jacket, a boy wore a waistcoat to keep warm. Knitted woolly jumpers or 'sweaters' weren't seen as much as they are now but started to be worn a lot more during and after World War One. 
 Boys wore petticoats or dresses, like their sisters, until they were around three or four years old. 
 Young boys wore knee-length, baggy shorts and long woollen socks. Older boys wore trousers. Both outfits were teamed with sturdy leather boots. There was a fashion for dressing very young boys from rich families in navy blue 'sailor suits'. 
 It was also fashionable for upper and middle class boys to wear stiff, detachable collars which folded flat over the tops of their jackets or waistcoats. They were called 'Eton collars' because they imitated the uniform of the boys at the wealthy Eton College. Working class boys usually wore collarless shirts with a V-neck woollen pullover.
 Uniforms were mostly worn at schools where richer families sent their children. Boys from poorer families went to 'board schools', which did not have uniforms. School uniforms only became popular at these schools in the 1920s.
 Outdoors, boys from working families wore flat caps with peaks. Boys from richer families might wear their school caps, or in warm weather, round straw hats called 'boaters'. 
 Boys had their hair cut short, especially at the back of the neck and around the ears.
