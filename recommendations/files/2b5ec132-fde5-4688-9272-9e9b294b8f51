* Who was Kitchener?

 * His death 
 Horatio Herbert Kitchener was born in 1850 in Ballylongford, Ireland. 
 He was born at a shooting lodge, where people hunted and shot birds. 
 His father was Lieutenant Henry Horatio Kitchener and his mother was called Frances. His father did not like schools, so a private tutor taught Kitchener at home. 
 In 1864 the Kitchener family moved to Switzerland because Frances was ill. 
 The family thought that the clear Swiss air and better weather would help her to get better. However, it did not and she died that same year. 
 Two years later, Kitchener's father got married again and moved away from Switzerland. Kitchener, however, stayed there and continued on at school.
 When he was eighteen, Kitchener passed the entrance exams for the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich, England. 
 There, he trained to become a soldier so that he could join the army. 
 Kitchener was influenced by his father, who was an officer in the British Army. 
 He grew up in a strict family and had to work very hard to get attention and rewards from his parents, especially his father. 
 He became very hard-working and this led him to be a strong, well-organised leader when he grew up.
