 Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. Eighty one years after this extraordinary feat, three new photographs have been discovered.
 Amelia Earhart was America's 'Queen of the Air'. 
 On May 20 1932 she set off from Newfoundland to attempt her record breaking transatlantic crossing. The next day, after a flight lasting almost 15 hours, she landed her bright red, state-of-the art aircraft in a small field outside Londonderry. The people of Derry - where even a car was still a novelty - flocked to see this feminist celebrity. 
 Eighty one years later, the event is being celebrated in Derry in the UK City of Culture's Amelia Earhart Festival. Joe Campbell, who has illustrated graphic novels on Earhart, describes her achievement and the wonder of three new images coming to light.
