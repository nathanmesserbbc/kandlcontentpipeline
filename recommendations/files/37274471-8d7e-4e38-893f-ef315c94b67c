 Many women travelled to the war zones, far from their homes. For many, this was the first time they had been away from Britain. 
 Conditions on the front line were dangerous. Women were at risk from enemy fire, but not to the same extent as men in the trenches. 
 After working long hours, women returned to base for a basic meal of rationed food for dinner. They rarely had bunk beds and instead slept on uncomfortable camp beds where they got a few hours of sleep before they had to be up again for duty early the next morning. Most nurses worked shifts and so sometimes worked at night and slept during the day.
