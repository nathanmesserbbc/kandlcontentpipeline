What is it about the Northern Lights that fascinates people so much? Maybe we associate them with the wild edges of the Earth, far away from civilisation, where strange unexpected phenomena are still possible. Or perhaps they remind us of our planet's connection to the Sun and the wider solar system.
 Interest in tours to places like Norway and Iceland to see the Northern Lights (or 'aurora borealis', as they are also known) has soared over the last few years. But if the conditions are right, the Northern Lights can be seen in the United Kingdom. And knowing something about the science behind them, gives you the best chance of catching a glimpse of their mysterious magical glow.
