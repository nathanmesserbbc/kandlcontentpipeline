* Who was Kitchener? 
 * Before the war 
 * War and that poster 
 * His death 
 When the war began, most people thought that it would be over very quickly.
 A common belief was that it would end by Christmas 1914. Kitchener had a completely different view. 
 He predicted that the war would last for three or four years and that millions of men would be needed to fight. He was right. 
 1. Soldier recruitment 
 Kitchener's first role was to look after soldier recruitment. This meant that he had to persuade men to fight for Britain in the war. A famous poster with his face on it was designed in 1914. 
 In the picture, he pointed and stared directly at whoever was looking at it. (If you study the poster today, his finger seems to follow you around the room). The caption said 'Your country needs you'. 
 At first, Kitchener wanted to recruit 100,000 volunteers. 
 However, so many men wanted to show support for their country that in the end 2,467,000 volunteered. This was over 24 times more than expected. 
 The army was not prepared for this number of men and did not have enough rifles or uniforms for them all. It was the largest volunteer army the world had ever seen.
 2. British industries
 Kitchener's second role was to manage British industries. These included the production of steel, gas and machines. 
 As Kitchener was also encouraging men to go out to war, there was no one left to work in the factories. 
 Therefore, women filled the gap in these jobs. Many worked in munitions factories making weapons, shells and other ammunition.
 3. Army strategy
 Kitchener's third role was to make plans for the army. He had to prepare the troops for a long war and help them to win a number of battles.
