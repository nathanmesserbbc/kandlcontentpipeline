This clip shows the national commemoration of Remembrance Sunday at the Cenotaph. Remembrance Day began in 1919 when people gathered to remember loved ones they had lost in the war. Today it is a national day of commemoration, replicated at memorials around the United Kingdom and in many parts of the world. 
 In the clip, we see the wreath-laying at the Cenotaph, as well as a school head teacher and a pupil talking about what it means to them. We see shots of war cemeteries with rows of memorials and graves. We are reminded that the war affected people in many countries, including India, France, Canada, Australia, Russia and the United States. People in Germany, Austria and other countries that fought against Britain and its allies in World War One also remember their losses. The clip concludes with images of memorials and the well-known lines, 'For your tomorrow, we gave our today'.
 You could follow up on the video by asking the class to plot the global extent of World War One on a world map. Pupils could identify the combatant countries involved across Europe and beyond. These include France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Russia, Portugal, Turkey, India, parts of Africa and the Caribbean as well as China, Japan, Brazil and Greece. Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Canada were all drawn into the fighting too.
