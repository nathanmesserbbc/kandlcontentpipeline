 World War One even changed children's games. In the autumn of 1917, when conkers fell from horse chestnut trees, children went out and collected them - not to play with, but to help with the war. 
 Chemicals from conkers were used in factories, to make a substance called cordite. Cordite was an ingredient in explosive shells and bullets.
 Making money
 In 1917 a hundredweight of conkers (roughly 50kg) would earn you seven shillings and sixpence, approximately Â£23.00 in modern money. 
 Posters were put up in schools, encouraging children to gather conkers. Boy Scout leaders helped organise collections.
 The conkers were sent by train to top-secret factories at Holton Heath in Dorset and King's Lynn in Norfolk. Around 3,000 tonnes of conkers were collected by Britain's children in 1917.
 The plan wasn't a great success. Conkers were a poor source of acetone, the chemical needed to make cordite. In the end, piles of unused conkers were just left to rot!
