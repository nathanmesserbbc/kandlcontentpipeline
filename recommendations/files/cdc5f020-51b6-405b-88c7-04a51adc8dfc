The poets of World War One - Sassoon, Owen, Blunden - have acquired an almost celebrity status. Books about the war such as All Quiet on the Western Front and A Farewell to Arms have become bestsellers. But the work of composers who fought in the trenches has largely been forgotten.
 Ivor Gurney and George Butterworth belonged to a generation of composers known as the 'pastoral school' who took their inspiration from rural life in England. Like Ralph Vaughan Williams, Butterworth was a great collector of English folk songs. Cecil Coles was assistant conductor at the Stuttgart Royal Opera House before he returned to Britain in 1913.
 Before the war, music halls were a popular form of entertainment but there was also a thriving classical music scene. Gramophones were expensive and the radio had yet to be invented, so to listen to music the public had to attend concerts. And they had a rich variety to choose from.
