 Rest time
 Night time was usually busy in the trenches. This was when soldiers had to work. It was only during the day time, that soldiers had time for relaxation and sleep. 
 As well as the fighting and problems with health, one of the biggest issues that faced soldiers on the front line was homesickness. 
 Soldiers sometimes had to spend months away from home fighting. Often, they only got ten days of leave (holiday) in a year. However, they were allowed to write letters home to their loved ones. They were given postcards or headed paper that allowed them to write home for free.
 Most letters sent from the front line were read by an officer who checked it was acceptable to send. He checked for anything that might give away British army secrets. 
 He also made sure that letters were not too sad, so they did not spoil the morale (the way people felt) back home. This was called censorship. Some could be sent without being read. Soldiers were trusted not to give information away.
 As well as letters and postcards, newspapers were also sometimes delivered to the trenches. This meant the soldiers could keep up to date with what was happening in the war, at home and in other parts of the world.
