"To become angry is easy. To be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, for the right purpose and in the right way - that is not easy," Aristotle said.
 This journey through Lent invites you to reflect on episodes in Jesus' life and feel inside what it might have been like to be there. 
 Exercises and Readings
* Take 10 minutes to relax and reflect on the story of the Prodigal Son. Imagine you are the older brother at home. What are you feeling when your brother returns? Why is he angry?
 * Now imagine you are the younger brother destitute and far away from home. What are you feeling as you wonder what to do?
 * Are you scared of your own anger or frightened when others are angry? 
 * Can you remember when a 'righteous anger' changed a situation for the better? Did this feel different to other occasions when you were angry?
 * How do you feel when others are angry with you?
 There is no doubt that one of the most disturbing of human emotions everyone feels from time to time is that of anger. It is both terrifyingly destructive yet, paradoxically, can be profoundly creative.
 Like tears of grief or spontaneous laughter, anger is an emotion that can be uncontrollable. It might then manifest itself as "temper" and it can be described as "blind" or "hot".
 On the other hand, anger can be an energising force for good when combating blatant evil or profound injustice.
 Human beings would not be moral creatures if an abused child or a Nazi extermination camp did not evoke a deep anger sufficient to rescue a victim or right a wrong.
 Anger is not necessarily wicked but, as Aristotle pointed out, to focus anger is not easy but it is necessary in the fight between good and evil.
 The letter to the Christians in Ephesus has some wise advice. "Be angry but do not sin" is a warning to exercise self control and the plea not to let the sun go down on your anger is a sound remedy against a nurtured resentment.
 Jesus of Nazareth understood anger. His own anger is evident when he drove out the traders in the Temple precincts. 
 He is reported to have been angry in the synagogue when the authorities were critical that he had healed a man's arm on the Sabbath. 
 He told the story of a wayward son who squanders his inheritance but is welcomed home by his father much to the anger of his elder brother. The Father would be much more justified in being angry than his eldest son but he appears to understand and accepts his anger refusing to let it ruin the occasion or mar their relationship. He is at pains simply to reassure him, "You are always with me and all that is mine is yours."
 Gracious God, slow to anger and of great kindness, deliver us from the blind anger that seeks to destroy and give us courage to confront every injustice with the righteous energy to overcome all evil in the power of Jesus Christ our Saviour.
