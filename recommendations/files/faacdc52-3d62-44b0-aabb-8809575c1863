From the start of the war the British government was eager to control the flow of information from the front line, passing legislation in 1914 which allowed the War Office to censor the press and raising the spectre of the death penalty for anyone convicted of assisting the enemy. Lord Kitchener, Secretary of State for War, had crossed swords with the press in the Sudan and the Boer War and believed battle grounds were the exclusive preserve of the armed forces.
 Within a year a handful of journalists had become officially 'embedded' with the British Army, and at the war's end a select few would be honoured for their work.
 But until March 1915 men such as Philip Gibbs and Basil Clarke, who defied the ban, lived like fugitives in France, and smuggled back their dispatches any way they could. What was it like spending the early months of the war living as journalist outlaws?
