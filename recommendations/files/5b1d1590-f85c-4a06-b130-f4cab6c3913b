Iron, nickel and cobalt contain tiny regions called magnetic domains, in which electrons align in the same direction. These domains point in different directions so tend to cancel each other out.
 When one of these metals is exposed to a strong magnetic field the domains are encouraged to align, which turns it into a temporary magnet. 
 This is how a steel needle (which contains iron) becomes magnetised when stroked by a permanent magnet. 
 Why does a compass point north?
 Once the needle is magnetised it naturally wants to align with the Earth's stronger magnetic field.
 Scientists believe this field, called the magnetosphere, is created by electrical currents that are generated by a churning molten iron core deep inside the planet.
 It means the Earth acts as if it has a bar magnet running through it with the magnet's south pole located near the planet's geographic north. Since opposites attract the north pole of a magnetised needle is attracted towards it.
