 One of the most famous battles was the Battle of the Somme which started in July 1916 in France. It involved Britain, France and Germany. 
 This battle was an example of trench warfare, where long ditches or 'trenches' were dug in the ground. 
 Soldiers lived in the trenches and sometimes they climbed out of them to attack. 
 The land between the opposing trenches which soldiers had to cross was called No Man's Land.
 The Battle of the Somme was a very bloody battle. In total, around one million soldiers were killed, wounded or missing: 420,000 from Britain, 200,000 from France and 500,000 from Germany. 
 An army General called Sir Douglas Haig commanded the British army. After the war was over, many people blamed him for so many deaths and casualties. They thought that he had not led his troops in the right way. People felt that very little ground was gained for so many deaths and that he should have changed his tactics after 19,000 British soldiers were killed on the first day of the battle.
 A total of 65 million troops from around the world fought in the war. This included the British army, which was made up of around 4 million men from England, 558,000 men from Scotland, 273,000 men from Wales and 134,000 men from Ireland. Just under 1 million British troops died. 
 Later in the war, Germany announced that it would attack any ship that sailed towards Britain. 
 At this point, the United States of America decided Germany was breaking international treaties and Europe needed help. The US President declared war on Germany in April 1917. He thought that he could help bring peace to Europe.
