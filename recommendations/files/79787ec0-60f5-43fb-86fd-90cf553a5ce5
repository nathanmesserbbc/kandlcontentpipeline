* Before the war 
 * School dinners 
 * Home front food 
 The cost of food more than doubled during the war years. Some prices went up by even more than that. A pint of milk cost a penny in the early 1900s. Just after the war, people were expected to pay sixpence a pint.
 As the fighting dragged on, fresh fruit, vegetables and meat got harder to find. There were even stories of butchers selling dead cats! 
 Bread and flour were very hard to get. By 1916, bread was being made from ground-up turnips. The new Ministry for Food put out a leaflet with ideas for making pastry, cakes and buns from potatoes, and even 'chocolate potato biscuits'.
 Mothers had to be inventive in the kitchen. Wartime cookbooks had ideas for foods like 'potted cheese' - leftover crumbs of cheese, mixed with mustard and margarine, baked in the oven and served with biscuits or toast. Another recipe used cooked fish, rice, and breadcrumbs to make 'fish sausages'.
 'The Win-the-War Cookery Book' carried this message: 'Women of Britain â€¦ Our soldiers are beating the Germans on land. Our sailors are beating them on the sea. You can beat them in the larder and the kitchen.'
 In 1918, Britain brought in a system of rationing, where what food there was got shared out more fairly. 
 Everyone was given a ration book that showed how much food they were allowed to buy, including sugar, meat, flour, butter, margarine and milk. 
 Even King George and Queen Mary had ration books. Richer families discovered what it was like to go hungry. Some of the poorest families, however, found rationing left them better-fed than before the war. 
 Wartime also produced some new foods: dried soup powder, and custard that just needed water adding. There was even a recipe to make Christmas pudding, using 'egg substitute'.
