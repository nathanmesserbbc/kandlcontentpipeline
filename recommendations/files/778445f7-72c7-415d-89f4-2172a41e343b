Britain's leading architects are at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London for a discussion chaired by Philip Dodd.
 On the panel are Michael Hopkins, Nicholas Grimshaw, Norman Foster, Patty Hopkins, Richard Rogers and Terry Farrell.
 It is part of the Brits Who Built The Modern World season - a major programme of exhibitions and events organised by the RIBA. In these highlights from the event, the panellists explore their own contribution to the development of British architecture.
 The Brits Who Built The Modern World season tells the story of how British architecture developed globally from 1750 to the present. It includes the opening of a new gallery at the RIBA, an exhibition at the V&amp;A and a series on BBC Four.
