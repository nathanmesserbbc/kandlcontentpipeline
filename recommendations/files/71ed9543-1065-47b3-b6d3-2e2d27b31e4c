Belfast celebrates its 400th birthday this month. On 27 April 1613, King James I granted a Royal Charter to what was a quiet landing spot, setting in place the foundations for a great city. 
 This slideshow looks back 100 years to Belfast's last significant birthday. It offers a rare glimpse, through haunting images by photographer Alex Hogg, of the poor backstreets behind a booming global hub for ship building and linen manufacture.
 Narration is by Dr Olwen Purdue, Lecturer in Modern Irish History at Queen's University and editor of 'Belfast, The Emerging City'.
