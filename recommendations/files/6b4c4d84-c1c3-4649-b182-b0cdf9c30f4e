When we think of World War One we picture weary soldiers 'coughing like hags' cursing as they wade through 'the sludge' of the trenches. We hear the 'guttering' and 'gargling' of a dying man and almost taste the 'green sea' of lethal mustard gas.
 These vivid impressions sprang from the pen of Wilfred Owen, a junior officer in the trenches. He joined up as a patriotic idealist but became disillusioned as a result of first-hand experience of battle. It is easy to assume that the powerful words of this young man from Shropshire captured the true experience of the war. But is that assumption right? Or has our focus on poems like Owen's distorted our view of the war?
