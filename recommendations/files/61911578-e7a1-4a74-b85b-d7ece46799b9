BBC RE:Think is a brand new fixture for the festival calendar. Hosted by the BBC's Religion and Ethics department from its home at MediaCityUK, this two day event will explore the essential issues of faith, philosophy and ethics.
 The festival is both broad church and non-church, and promises to inspire with searching and provocative debate. 
 Sessions will examine different aspects of faith and ethics in the UK. Speakers include Richard Dawkins, the chief rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, veteran BBC journalist Jeremy Bowen and historian Bettany Hughes.
