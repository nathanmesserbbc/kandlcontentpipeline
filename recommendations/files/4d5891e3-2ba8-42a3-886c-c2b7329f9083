Taking time to get the location right when you move will save you time and money, whether you are buying or renting.
 If you are moving to a place you don't know well, it can really pay to work out which part of town is right for you. If you end up somewhere you can't live with, there is all the stress and expense of moving again.

 Tips from a frequent mover
 Andrew Iles has moved to a new house in Southampton. It's his 10th move in 11 years and he knows exactly what he wants.
 "I always live within walking distance of town to save money on taxis when I go out in the evening.
 "I also try to make sure I can walk to work, and that there's a park close by for the dogs, which cuts down on fuel.
 "De-cluttering before I move means I can fit everything in a van, which I hire for about Â£45 per day." 
 You really don't want to move into your new house, only to discover a few months down the line that it's not right for you and you have to splash out on another move. 
 So make sure you do your research.
 Visit the house several times on different days and at different times. 
 If you're moving to a university town or city, try to visit during term time.
 Estate agent Michael Jones warns against snap decisions. "Some people can make a decision to buy a house in 15 minutes, but there's so much you miss in the first viewing," he says. 
 "It's amazing how little time people spend looking at something which is probably the greatest expense in their life. "
 If you have any doubts about the area, consider a short-term rent first.
