A new Hercule Poirot book is being written, nearly 40 years since the death of his creator, Agatha Christie. 
 The author of the new book, Sophie Hannah, said she has written a 100-page plan detailing every development in the plot, although she has yet to start writing the novel itself. 
 Ms Hannah told the Today programme's Sarah Montague that although she would not try to emulate Christie's style, she would be faithful to the central character. 
 She said: "I know Hercule Poirot so well. I've read all the books in which he stars, several times. I started reading him when I was 12 so, you know, he's a very familiar and much-loved character to me and I wouldn't want to change him in any particular."
 Matthew Pritchard, Christie's grandson, believes his grandmother would have approved of a new Poirot instalment.
 He explained: "The reason she wrote books is so that others could read them, and enjoy them. And I think that she was convinced that this was a way of reigniting the interest in not only the book itself, but in her own books. 
 "Hopefully we've found a way to encourage people to read the original books she wrote, including the new one," he added. 
 First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Wednesday 4 September 2013.
