 * Weekends and holidays 
 * Fathers at war 
 Children would wait anxiously for news of their fathers away fighting. 
 Soldiers were allowed to send letters and postcards home from time to time, to keep in touch with their families, but these were censored to make sure that useful information would not fall into German hands. 
 Annual leave
 Some soldiers would have as little as three days leave a year. 
 About once a year, each soldier was given a few days to come home on leave though sometimes this would only amount to as little as three days. Families looked forward to these days.
 Mothers dreaded getting a telegram, because that was how the army told relatives that a soldier had been killed, seriously wounded or missing in action. Many fathers didn't come back from the war. Estimates vary, but between 300,000 and 500,000 British children had to cope with the death of their father in the war years. 
 Some children were so young when their fathers went off to be soldiers, that they could hardly remember them. Many mothers faced bringing up their children on their own, with little or no help and only a small pension.
