Before the war, the only way to travel around the world was by ship. 
 Britain had the biggest empire in the world and needed a lot of ships to transport goods and people. Britain also had the largest navy in the world, to help protect the nation and its Empire. 
 Britain had many shipyards to build ships needed for trade, travel and the Navy and the start of war meant that even more new ships were needed. The shipyards in Britain were kept very busy keeping up with demand. 
 Shipyards needed to keep skilled men to produce battleships for the Navy. They also altered trade and passenger ships and fishing boats to make them suitable to help in the war. Some ship builders were not allowed to volunteer for the armed forces and were exempt from conscription (excused from going to war) when it was introduced.
