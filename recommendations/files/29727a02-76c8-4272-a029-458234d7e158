 * Remembering Walter 
 Walter Tull was one of many soldiers killed whose bodies were never found. 
 Their names are listed on war memorials. Walter's name is listed on the war memorial at Arras in France. It has nearly 35,000 names of men with 'no known graves'. Walter is also remembered on his parents' gravestone in Folkestone.
 Walter is remembered as one of the first black footballers, and as the first black person to lead British soldiers in battle. 
 For many of his friends, Walter was probably the first black or mixed-race person they had met. There were millions of black, Asian or mixed race people in the British Empire, but in 1914 only a small number were living in Britain.
 Walter Tull is remembered by his football clubs, and in the places where he lived. There is a memorial to him in Northampton, and a road leading to the football ground is named Walter Tull Way. 
 There are memorials to Walter in Folkestone and Dover, both in Kent. For his work as a soldier, he was awarded the 1914-15 Star and the War and Victory medals.
