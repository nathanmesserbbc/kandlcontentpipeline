 The 'Remembrance' video helps children to reflect on the 2014 centenary of World War One and to explore why remembrance has become part of national life in the UK and other countries. 
 When did poppy-wearing begin? Why was the poppy chosen as the symbol of remembrance? Watch this clip to find out. 
 Remembrance Day began in 1919 when people gathered to remember loved ones they had lost in the war. Today it is a national day of commemoration, replicated at memorials around the United Kingdom and in many parts of the world. 
 Britain today is generally considered to be at peace. Yet we face the dangers of terrorism and soldiers still risk their lives in wars and peace-keeping missions. Can war be avoided?
