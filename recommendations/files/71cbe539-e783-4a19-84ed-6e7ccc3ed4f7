 Jack's father was Eli Cornwell. He was born in the country, and had been a soldier and a milkman. 
 Eli and his first wife Alice Carpenter had two children, Arthur and Alice. With his second wife, Lily King, Eli had four children - Ernest, John, George and Lily. 
 John Travers Cornwell was born in Leyton in Essex (now in the London borough of Newham) on 8 January 1900. To his family and friends, John soon became 'Jack'. 
 The Cornwell family were not rich, but they got by. Jack's father drove trams (vehicles a bit like buses but which run on rails like trains). 
 Jack first went to school in Leyton, but in 1910 the family moved to a new home in Little Ilford.
 Jack went to Walton Road School in Manor Park. This was a new school, built in 1900. Lots of new schools were being built at this time. Every child was supposed to go to school between the ages of 5 and 14, though some left early, at 12 or 13, to go to work. 
 In 1929 Jack's old school was renamed the Cornwell School, in his honour.

 Lots of boys wanted to join the Boy Scouts (the first Scout Rally was in 1909). The idea for Scouts came from Robert Baden-Powell, a soldier who wrote a book called Scouting for Boys to appeal to boys' love of outdoor adventures. 
 Jack became a Scout with the Little Ilford troop. He was a good Scout, proud of his badges, and was praised for rescuing a girl stuck in a drain.
 When Jack left school, in 1913, he got a job as a delivery boy. He worked on vans delivering goods for a tea company. He may also have worked for a company making beer, called a brewer, on a dray (a big horse-drawn wagon).
