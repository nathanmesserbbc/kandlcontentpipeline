 Some people enjoy taking tests like The Great British Class Survey while others do not. This means that the people who participate in online surveys might not necessarily represent the general public. Professors Mike Savage and Fiona Devine explain how they managed to get meaningful results from the BBC Lab UK data. 
 The web survey was launched on 26 January 2011 with extensive publicity across BBC television and radio. The response from the general public was very enthusiastic. By July 2011, over 161,400 people had completed The Great British Class Survey on the BBC Lab UK website. Although people continued to take part in the survey, it was this group of people whose answers contributed to the results.

 Selection bias is a common problem in web surveys although it can be overcome"
 We watched with excitement as the number of people completing the web survey increased daily. We quickly realised, however, that our participants were not representative of the population at large. We found that the survey suffered from what social scientists call 'selection bias'. This meant, the people answering our questionnaire were largely drawn from well-educated social groups. This made it difficult to apply these results to the British population as a whole.
 To address this, the BBC allowed us to carry out a nationally representative sample survey to complement The Great British Class Survey. A well-known survey organisation called GfK conducted a face-to-face survey using exactly the same questions that appeared on the BBC UK Lab website. This survey was undertaken in April 2011 and 1,026 people completed the questionnaire. Using established quota sampling methods, a representative range of people were interviewed across the country.
 The table below shows the difference in the proportions of social class between the two surveys.
 We can see from the table that there are far more people from the traditional professions in the web sample compared to the national figures from the GfK survey. The proportion of senior managers, modern professionals and middle class is also over-represented when compared to the national survey. In contrast, the working-classes are under-represented in the web sample - especially the routine and technical craft workers. 
 There was also another problem. When we cross-checked our sample with other research, we found that the people from working-class positions who completed The Great British Class Survey turned out to be unrepresentative of people like them in other surveys. They had relatively more cultural and social capital than you might expect and were more inclined to participate in research like this.
 These findings meant that The Great British Class Survey alone could not be used to develop a representative model of British class. The GfK survey had to be used alongside it.
 When we examined the results, we used a statistical technique called latent class analysis. This allowed us to group people into classes, using the measurements we created to quantify cultural, social and economic capital. We combined the cases from the two surveys into the analysis, but we weighted The Great British Class Survey so that its hundreds of thousands of participants were equivalent to one case of the nationally representative GfK survey. Doing this meant that the results were not distorted by the unrepresentative web survey. 
 During this analysis we had many opportunities to talk to specialists in survey research and statistical methods to ensure we were doing the right thing. 
 The findings have been published in the journal Sociology and were presented at a conference of the British Sociological Association.

 The data from the Great British Class Survey was analysed by a team including Niall Cunningham, Yaojun Li and Andrew Miles from the University of Manchester, Mark Taylor from the University of York, Sam Friedman from City University, Johs. Hjellbrekke from the University of Bergen, Norway and Brigette Le Roux of Universite Paris Descartes, France.
