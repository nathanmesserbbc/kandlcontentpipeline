Dr Gregory Tate of the University of Surrey explores how the end of a remarkable friendship set the stage for perhaps the greatest intellectual battle in modern history.
 In 1799 a young chemist named Humphry Davy met his idol, the celebrated poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The two bonded over their love of poetry and their fascination with the natural world, and together they experimented with the newly-discovered nitrous oxide (laughing gas).
 But the gas would also come to symbolise and reinforce their opposing philosophies, and as they grew older they grew further apart. Eventually their friendship reached breaking point. What happened next would set in motion a chain of events that would lead to a fundamental separation between emotion and reason that is still with us today.
 This is one of a series of films made as part of New Generation Thinkers: each year producers from BBC Radio 3 and BBC Arts, together with the Arts and Humanities Research Council, select a group of young academics who have the potential to turn their ground breaking ideas into sensational broadcasting.
