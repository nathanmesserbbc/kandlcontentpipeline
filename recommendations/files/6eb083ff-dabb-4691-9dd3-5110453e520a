 Letters and postcards were an important way to keep in touch and getting information from home cheered up the soldiers. 
 They wrote replies but did not want their families to know how terrible things were in the trenches. 
 Soldiers chose their words carefully because all letters would be read by the censor (someone who examines books and letters and removes things thought to be harmful or offensive) who would strike out information that might be secret. 
 Before the war, women working for the Post Office had only been allowed to sort letters. 
 However, in the four months after war was declared, 28,000 men left their jobs in the Post Office to join the armed forces. Through necessity women were now allowed to deliver the post as well. 
 No one thought the war would last long but by 1916, it was clear the men would not be back to their jobs for some time. 
 The Post Office decided that women should have uniforms too. They wore a blue hat, a heavy blue coat and skirt and boots. In bad weather, they also wore a waterproof cape.
 With so many men away from home, a huge number of letters and cards had to be delivered. 
 Two billion letters
 The Army Postal Service handled all the post going to and from troops in Europe at their special sorting office called the Home Depot. 
 To deal with the huge amount of wartime post (2 billion letters and 114 million parcels) the Home Depot became that the largest wooden building in the world at the time. 
Throughout the war, posting a letter had cost a penny, and it had been that price for 75 years. In 1918, the price increased by half a penny to 1Â½ d.
 A soldier could also send field postcards. These had no pictures, just some printed sentences and soldiers had to select the right message. 
 It was a quick way to let people at home know all was well and that their letter or parcel had arrived.
