 Before World War One, the British army had been involved in many wars overseas. These were mainly fought in countries that either were or would become part of Britain's Empire, places in the world under Britain's power. 
 The most recent war had been the Boer War in the country we now call South Africa. Men had led the battles and undertaken all roles on the front line. By contrast, women had stayed at home in Britain where, if they were married, they focused on looking after their homes and bringing up children. Single women were more likely to go out to work. However, they were often found in domestic roles such as servants and housekeepers.
 The war effort
 World War One was the first war to directly involve women in the war effort both at home and abroad. Many new roles were created for women which meant they acquired new skills and knowledge. Their new roles also came with more responsibility. This was a dramatic change from life as women knew it before the war. 
 The attacks on Belgium, France and other European countries at war meant that thousands of families saw their homes destroyed by battles and they became homeless refugees. In Britain, most civilians had felt safe, but World War One was a new kind of war. This was because the war came to Britain's doorstep and most people were at risk from Zeppelins and bombing raids which could happen at any time. 
 As well as encouraging their men folk to join the Army, as government posters urged them to do, women were soon directly involved in the war. As the war progressed, many went to work overseas where the fighting was taking place. Thousands of women, old and young, volunteered to help the war effort both at home and abroad. Some wealthy women ran charities to help soldiers or turned their homes into hospitals or convalescent homes. Many young women left home for the first time to help in the war effort. At first some women saw the war as an adventure but they quickly realised it was very different to war-stories they had read. 
 Only men were officially allowed to fight as soldiers during World War One. Many people felt that it was inappropriate for women to fight and that it was against their caring character. Brave women went into action to help the war effort in other ways.
