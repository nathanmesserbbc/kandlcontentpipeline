 	 Girls and boys were expected to do different work to help with the war effort. Girls knitted socks and scarves to keep the British soldiers (nicknamed Tommies) warm in the trenches. 
 They worked on vegetable patches and on farms too, digging and weeding. They gathered fruit and other things to eat at harvest time.
 Posters encouraged people to collect hens' eggs to feed wounded soldiers. Both girls and boys helped with this job. Many homes kept chickens during the war, if they had space outside. 
 A film from the Ministry of Information asked people to save the bones from their meat. The film said bones could be used to help make munitions and girls helped with the collection.
 Secret agents
 Some reports say that Girl Guides carried messages for MI5, the British Secret Service, during the war years. 
 The story goes that Boy Scouts were MI5's first choice for this work, but they turned out to be too naughty and too talkative! 
 Britain's secret agents turned to the Girl Guides for help instead.
 Girl Guides carried important messages and helped deliver milk. Guides also parcelled up clothing, such as knitwear, to be sent to soldiers at the Front. 
 Guides learned first aid so they could help with injuries. Guides in Scotland collected sphagnum moss, which was used to cover and treat war wounds. 
 One 1917 newsreel shows Girl Guides marching in the street. Another shows them learning to send messages using small flags. The film goes on to show Girl Guides learning how to use a stretcher to carry an injured person.
