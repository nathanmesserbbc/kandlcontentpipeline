 All parents want their children to be as safe as possible when they're online or using internet-enabled devices such as smartphones, tablets and games consoles.
 The best thing you can do to protect your child, whatever age they are, is to talk to them about what they do online and be aware of the kind of activities they typically get up to on their laptop, tablet, smartphone or connected games console. 
 Encourage them to speak to you if they see anything that upsets them, keep the dialogue open and ask your child which sites they are visiting, and who they are chatting and sending messages to. Take the time to look at some of the sites, apps or games they mention.
