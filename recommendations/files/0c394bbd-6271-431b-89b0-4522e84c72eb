Each year producers from BBC Radio 3, BBC Arts, together with the Arts and Humanities Research Council, select a group of young academics who have the potential to turn their ground breaking ideas into sensational broadcasting.
 The scheme receives hundreds of applications from academics who are at the start of their careers and are passionate about communicating modern scholarship to a wider audience. 
 Having already appeared on BBC Radio 3 and at the Free Thinking Festival of Ideas at Sage in Gateshead, the current intake of New Generation Thinkers have been working with BBC Arts to develop their ideas for a television audience.
 The short films, featuring the academics whose specialisms range from how Victorian poets contributed to new scientific ideas, to the influence of ancient Greek philosophy on modern day therapy, can be viewed using the links below.
