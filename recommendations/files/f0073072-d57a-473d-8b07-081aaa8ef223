How was this beautiful photo of the night sky above Kielder Observatory in Northumberland taken by Mike Ridley?
* Digital SLR only
 * Compact camera, through a telescope
 * Smart phone, through a telescope
 The Sculptor Galaxy was snapped by Tanja Sund - but how did she capture it?
* A compact camera through a telescope
 * A digital SLR with a zoom lens
 * A digital SLR and a telescope, with multiple 'stacked' images
 The moon is a popular subject for astrophotographers, but what did Thomas North use to capture this stunning image?
* Webcam, through a telescope
 * Smart phone, through a telescope
 * Compact camera only
 What did Mick Hyde connect to his telescope to take this colourful picture of Saturn?
* Webcam
 * Compact camera
 * Digital SLR
 Jupiter's bands were captured without stacking software in this stunning picture, but how was it done?
* Smartphone, through a telescope
 * Digital SLR only
 * Compact camera, through a telescope
 Finally, how did Mike Crowle produce this picture of an interstellar cloud, known as the North American Nebula?
* Digital SLR and telescope (single shot)
 * Digital SLR and telescope (multiple stacked images)
 * Compact camera and telescope (single shot)
* Using the right settings with a digital SLR, you can capture detailed landscapes in front a starry backdrop without a telescope.
 * 'Stacking' means adding together the important parts of multiple photos. It can deliver incredible detail of distant objects.
 * A smart phone. If you have even a basic telescope, you don't necessarily need a high-tech camera to take beautiful photos of the night sky.
 * Video is the best way to look at bright planets. Cancel out any turbulence by 'stacking' the video frames taken by a webcam into a single image.
 * Gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are great targets for a compact camera connected to a telescope. The picture quality can be breath-taking.
 * Taking photos through a telescope with a digital SLR, then 'stacking' them with free software means you can produce pictures of nebulae without a tracking system.
