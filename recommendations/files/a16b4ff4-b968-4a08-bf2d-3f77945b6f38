The Lent season is one of the most important periods of the year for Christians worldwide, as it is a time for reflection on the human individual and universal condition. 
 Each year BBC Radio 4 and the 39 BBC local radio stations broadcast special programming during Lent, with downloadable resources available for individual study, for house groups or churches.

Churches, groups and individuals will be able to download free resources provided by Churches Together in Britain and Ireland which will complement and expand on the sermons and will help focus on the messages of Lent. 
 They take the title "Our Story - Journeys of Faith". As well as the free downloadable material, BBC Radio 4's Sunday Worship and Local Radio Sunday Breakfast Shows will take themes complementing the resources. 
 "My aim has been to help each one of us understand better the journey of faith to which we have been called both as a 'people of God' and individually. 
 "By saying, of the story of Israel and the story of Jesus, 'This is our story', we are saying that we want stories like the ones in the Bible, in which we see God at work in the past, to shape our lives today." 
 Sagovsky is also the first preacher in Radio 4's Sunday Worship Lent series (17 Feb).
 "There is much to be learnt by comparing the different ways in which they speak to different people," he adds. 
 "We are not the first to read them in this way. We are only the latest in a long line of people, both Jews and Christians, who have read these stories for illumination about the way God deals with humanity, and now deals with us. In doing so, we say 'this is our story'."
