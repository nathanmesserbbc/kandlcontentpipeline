Each year producers from BBC Radio 3 and BBC Television Arts, together with the Arts and Humanities Research Council, select a group of young academics who have the potential to turn their ground breaking ideas into sensational broadcasting.
 This year, hundreds of early-career academics applied for the chance to communicate their ideas to a mass audience, and this year's New Generation Thinkers have already appeared on BBC Radio 3's Night Waves and at the Free Thinking Festival of Ideas at The Sage in Gateshead.
 Now each of this year's New Generation Thinkers - whose specialisms range from astronomy to peanut allergy and from medical ethics to law - has been given the chance to make a film expanding on their field of research.
