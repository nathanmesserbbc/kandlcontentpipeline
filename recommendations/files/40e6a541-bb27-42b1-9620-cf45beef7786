Nearly half a million people in the UK are diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) every year. However, the number of actual cases is likely to be far higher as STIs can often be passed on unwittingly.
 Sexually transmitted infections are spread from person to person through sexual contact. These include more than 30 different bacteria, viruses or parasites. Others, such as HIV and syphilis, can then be passed on even further. This can occur either through blood transfusions or tissue transplants, or from a mother carrying the infection to her child during pregnancy and childbirth. 
 Left untreated, STIs can cause serious complications such as infertility and impotence and some may even prove fatal. 
 Recorded cases of infections are steadily rising. Whilst there is greater awareness and subsequent testing for the conditions, this is not the only reason. STIs are easily spread and maybe passed on before a person realises they have the disease. Younger adults are at greater risk as they are more likely to have unsafe sex with multiple sexual partners.
* Chlamydia: 186,196. Most of these were people aged 24 or younger
 * Genital herpes: 31,154
 * Genital warts: 76,071
 * Gonorrhoea: 20,965. The highest rates of gonorrhoea are seen in women aged 16-19 and men aged 20-24
 * HIV: 6,280
 * Infectious syphilis: 2,915
 Some infections, such as chlamydia and HIV, may not cause any obvious symptoms. Conditions like syphilis can cause painless sores that can easily be missed. The virus that causes genital herpes also usually has few initial symptoms, so 80% of people carrying it don't know they've been infected. 
 Other STIs don't cause symptoms straight away but can be spread during this window of time - it could take months before someone shows symptoms of genital warts, for example. 
 The virus that causes genital herpes also usually has few initial symptoms, so 80% of people carrying it don't know they've been infected. 
 Precautions such as wearing a condom are an important way to reduce the risk of STI's but still can't prevent the spread of parasitic infections like pubic lice.
