Welsh poet Ifor ap Glyn visits the shrine at Pennant Melangell, near the Snowdonia National Park; the small farming valley was the 6th Century home to Melangell, a princess who became a hermit after an unwanted marriage proposal.
 Legend has it that one day the local lord came through with his hunting pack, driving the wildlife before him. Some hares sought refuge under Melangell's cloak, and when the huntsmen raised their horns to their lips to call the dogs in for the kill, no sound emerged. The lord was so moved that he placed the valley and all its wildlife under Melangell's care and it became a place of Christian sanctuary.
 Pennant Melangell holds a special place in the hearts of many people, who, when visiting the shrine, leave messages and pray for loved ones who passed away. 
 It is now regarded as one of the holiest places in Britain.
