At the outbreak of war in 1914, the British Army had 700,000 available men. Germany's wartime army was over 3.7 million. When a campaign for volunteers was launched, thousands answered the call to fight. Among them were 250,000 boys and young men under the age of 19, the legal limit for armed service overseas. 
 For many, their experience of the war was no different to that of the adults they served alongside. It's estimated that around half of those who fought on the front line were wounded, died or taken prisoner. Why did so many boys lie about their age, or give false names so they could leave home and fight in a catastrophic war? And why did the authorities recruiting suitable candidates to serve King and country allow them?
