 Drying out
* Window blinds weren't common. Many bathrooms and kitchens (wet and steamy) had curtains made from oiled or rubberised cloth.
 * In some bathrooms, there were clothes-dryers on ropes that could be pulled up to the ceiling so wet clothes dripped into the bath.
 A typical bathroom had a metal bath and a ceramic or metal wash-basin. 
 Hot water for the bath gushed from a gas heater. It made a gurgling sound, like a hot spring. Only big houses and hotels had showers. The toilet was often separate, but sometimes in the bathroom. 
 The toilet was called the lavatory or water closet (WC). It had a wooden seat. It was flushed by 'pulling the chain' fixed to a lever on the cistern, or water tank. It was basically the same as a modern toilet, but without any plastic fittings - and with a chain.
 An indoor toilet was quite a luxury. Many poor families had an outside toilet, or a privy - a toilet in a shed. Town houses had water on tap, and drains connected to sewers. Most country homes got drinking water from a pump, and their toilets emptied into holes in the ground called cesspits.
 Toothbrushes had natural bristles made from animal hair. Nylon bristles were not invented until the 1930s. There was toothpaste in tubes, and solid toothpowder in a tin. People were nervous about going to the dentist because 1914 dentist's drills and painkilling injections were not as good as today's!
 Many sailors had beards and some men grew beards to copy King George V. Most men shaved every morning. A man kept his shaving brush and shaving soap in the bathroom. Some men liked old-fashioned 'cut-throat 'razors, which they sharpened or 'stropped' by rubbing them on a leather strap. Others chose new 'safety razors' with disposable razor blades.
