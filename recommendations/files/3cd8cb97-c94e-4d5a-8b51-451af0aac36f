We're likely to spend around Â£24bn on Christmas this year in the UK.
 More than a quarter of us will end up getting carried away and spending more than we can afford.
 So where does our money go and how can we keep within budget? Here are the stats along with the tips for a cheaper Christmas. 
* Instead of going out, encourage your friends to bring food and drinks to your home.
 * Avoid meals in restaurants. If your friends are eating out arrange to meet them afterwards.
 * If you're an office worker ask if you can book a meeting room, put up some decorations and have a whip round for food and drinks. 
 * If you normally buy presents for a group of friends or colleagues consider setting up a 'Secret Santa'.
 * If you're visiting friends or relatives after Christmas Day, consider buying their presents in the sales.
 The Money Advice Service's Christmas money planner can help you budget.
* Limit your shopping to one trip if possible - more shopping trips mean more impulse purchases.
 * Beware of two for one offers - it's only cheap if you need it.
 * Consider doing more online shopping where it's harder to be tempted. Follow our advice for using auction sites. 
 * Talk to your family about what they really want. You might agree to give smaller presents at Christmas and put the savings towards something else.

* Plan low cost activities like walks, visiting relatives or watching films at home.
 * Check your local paper for low cost events like carol services or switching on the lights in the town centre.
