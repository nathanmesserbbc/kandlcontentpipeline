 In the early 1900s, for a few pennies, people could buy the sheet music for a music hall song. It would have a picture of its famous singer on the cover. 
 The first verse of 'Belgium put the Kibosh on the Kaiser'
 It was made in Germany.
 The sheets had titles like: 'A Little Bit of Cucumber, Sung by Harry Champion', 'Algy, the Famous Song Success of Vesta Tilley', 'The Gas Inspector, Sung by Little Titch' or 'I Do Like to be Beside the Seaside, Sung by Mark Sheridan'. The singers were such big stars they always got a mention. 
 Families and friends would get together for a singalong at home to try out the songs for themselves. They might have joined in with Vesta Tilley's wartime song 'Jolly Good Luck to the Girl Who Loves a Soldier' or Mark Sheridan's 'Belgium Put the Kibosh on the Kaiser', which made fun of the German leader. Most children went to church, so they knew plenty of hymns, too. 
 In some homes, there might be a piano to provide the music, in others perhaps a banjo or ukulele. 
 MP3 players were far off in the future, but a rich home might have had a gramophone. It was wound up with a handle, until the music blared out from a brass horn. As well as orchestral music, the singing stars of the time made recordings of their greatest hits.
