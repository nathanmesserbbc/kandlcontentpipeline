* Who was Wilfred Owen? 
 * The war 
 * His poetry 
 * Death and legacy 
 Wilfred Owen was born in Shropshire, England in 1893. He was the eldest of four children. 
 He had two brothers, Harold and Colin, and one sister, Mary. His father worked on the railway. His mother was very protective of Wilfred and his brothers and sisters - she checked up on them all the time. 
 When he was four years old, Wilfred's family moved to Liverpool but they moved back to Shropshire when he was 13. 
 Wilfred went to a school near his home and he loved drama and poetry. He read lots of poems by John Keats. He liked the way that Keats created vivid pictures with his words. The words made Wilfred feel like he could see what Keats saw. 
 Wilfred came to love the English language and started writing his own poems when he was 17. 
 Wilfred wanted to study at university so he could improve his writing. 
 He applied to go to universities in London and Reading but did not get a place. This was mainly because he did not have enough money to live away from home. 
 Instead he decided to work as an assistant to a vicar. He thought this would help him raise the money he needed to go to university. 
 Wilfred eventually became a teacher and went to work at an English school in France. He met a French poet and learnt new styles of writing poetry.
