Steve Coogan worked as an impressionist on ITV's satirical puppet show Spitting Image from 1988 alongside John Sessions, Chris Barrie, Harry Enfield and Steve Nallon - voice of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
 Compared to the "colourful" characters in Thatcher's Cabinet, he says today's politicians have had their "creases ironed out". 
 His early career also included appearances on TV variety shows such as Sunday Night at the Palladium which was then mainstream comedy. He says he was seen as an "arriviste" compared to some of his "hip" peers who were working the comedy circuit, such as Rik Mayall, Stephen Fry and Ben Elton. 
 The full Mark Lawson Talks To... Steve Coogan interview is at 10pm on Tuesday 12 November on BBC Four, and is available afterwards on BBC iPlayer.
