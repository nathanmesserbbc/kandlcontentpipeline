Shell shock was a term used during WW1 to describe a condition that left soldiers with a range of symptoms, from facial tics to blindness, for which there was no obvious physical cause.
 By the time the war ended 80,000 had been treated for this, but modern estimates suggest the number of sufferers could have been as high as 325,000.
