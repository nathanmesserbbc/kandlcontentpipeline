In 1920 a Titanic memorial was erected in Belfast, the birthplace of the ship, "to the imperishable memory of those gallant Belfast men who lost their lives on 15th April 1912". 
 An anonymous poem published in the press at the time of the memorial offers a similar emphasis on the heroism of the Belfast men.
 This poem resonates with Belfast's own journey of association with Titanic from a feeling of initial shame to celebrating the ship and its memory.
 Here the words of the poem are put alongside images tracing a journey of more than 100 years. It focuses on the men who built Titanic, the ship itself, through to the new memorial unveiled in Belfast City's Hall last year to mark the centenary of the ship's sinking.
