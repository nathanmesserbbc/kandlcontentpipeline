 * Remembering Walter 
 Walter Tull was born in Folkestone, in Kent, on 28 April 1888. 
 His father Daniel was from Barbados, one of the islands in the Caribbean. He was a ship's carpenter, making things from wood. 
 Daniel settled in Britain in 1876 and worked as a joiner, making wooden furniture, doors and windows. At his local Methodist church he met Alice Palmer, from a farmworker's family. They were married and had six children, though sadly one died as a baby.
 Walter's mother died in 1895 when he was only seven. His father married again, to Alice's niece Clara, and a new baby was born. But in 1897 Daniel died suddenly. 
 Left to raise six children on her own, Walter's stepmother asked her church for help. It was decided that Walter and his brother Edward would be better cared for in an orphanage. The two boys went to live in Bethnal Green, in East London.
 The Kent countryside Walter was used to was famous for farms and orchards. Folkestone was a small seaside town in the 1890s. By contrast, London was the world's biggest city. 
 East London was a poor district, with docks, warehouses, factories and poor housing called slums. The streets were full of people and noise. 
 While at the orphanage, Walter went to school. He played cricket and football, and enjoyed visits to his family in Kent. 
 In 1900 his brother Edward went to live in Scotland. Edward was adopted by a dentist's family, who brought him up as if he was their own son. He also became a dentist. 
 After Walter left school he became an apprentice, learning the trade in a printing works. But his real love was football.
