 Old pennies
* Most children had a money box for pocket money. Usually it was 'coppers' - pennies and half-pennies. A silver sixpence was a treat.
 * At this time, £1 was worth 240 pennies or 20 shillings. The smallest coin was the farthing (¼ of a penny).
 Babies slept in wooden cots, with rails. Babies slept in their parents' bedroom until they were big enough for a 'grown up' bed. 
 In big families, with few bedrooms, children often had to share bedrooms - and beds. Bedding included a mattress, cotton or linen sheets, wool blankets and a soft eiderdown. Feather pillows were often put on top of a long pillow called a bolster. British people had not yet begun sleeping under duvets, but they liked patchwork quilts. Hot water bottles made of ceramic or metal were usually wrapped in a towel. Rubber hot water bottles were the latest thing. 
 More homes had electric light. A bedside lamp was safer than going to bed with a candle which could fall over and set light to bedclothes. Electric light was more modern than gas or oil lamps, which could be a bit smelly, though some older people said electric light was too bright and hurt their eyes. 
 Most children wore smaller versions of grownup clothes. Boys wore shorts (until old enough to wear long trousers), jackets, collars and ties, and heavy lace-up boots or shoes. Girls wore long skirts and stockings, and hardly ever wore trousers. Children didn't wear jeans, T-shirts or trainers. For games children wore tennis shoes and plimsolls. 
 Popular toys were dolls, teddies, zoo and farm animals, toy soldiers (metal not plastic), and wind-up toy trains and cars. War toys included toy guns and battleships. There were plenty of wooden toys too, such as pull-along carts. Children's books were popular, such as E. Nesbit's The Railway Children (1906), and children also liked comics and annuals, such as Tiger Tim's.
