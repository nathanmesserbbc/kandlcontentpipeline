Today we think of passion as an uncontrollable, often positive emotion, but the word itself comes from the Latin term for 'suffering'. So the passion of Jesus is the final period of his life, culminating with his crucifixion. Early Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem would walk what they believed was his final journey carrying the cross, and would stop for prayer along the route to reflect on his suffering. 
 Those who could not afford to travel to Jerusalem and walk the route themselves would also encounter the Passion story: in Bible readings, prayers and in church. In the 12th Century, plays of Christ's Passion started to become popular, at first consisting of readings from the Gospels illustrated with poetry and music.
 Believers felt that through their participation in the Passion events they too could become part of the story. Over the next couple of centuries, Latin was replaced by local languages and Passion plays were shaped to suit the different audiences â€“ and their different takes on the story.
