* Introduction 
 * Assembly 
 * Teachers' Notes 
 This assembly, on the theme of remembrance, helps children reflect on the 2014 centenary of World War One. 
 It gives pupils an opportunity to think about the impact of the war and to explore why remembrance has become part of national life in the UK and other countries. The materials include a script for teachers, along with classroom ideas and suggestions for further research. There are online resources too, including image galleries, video clips and audio clips.
 The assembly covers why we remember World War One and how that remembrance is marked, for example by Remembrance Sunday events in November, the two-minute silence, war memorials and poppy-wearing. The materials encourage the whole school community to think about the experiences of the men, women and children who lived through World War One and later conflicts. Pupils are asked to consider how learning about past wars can shape our attitude to present conflicts. 
 The assembly starts off by encouraging children to think about the word 'remembrance'. Can they suggest what 'remembrance' means? Can they talk about their own experience or knowledge of events surrounding Remembrance Sunday? Teachers may also wish to discuss how we mark anniversaries such as this in ways appropriate to our lives today. 
 The assembly offers an introduction to study topics in history, English, RE, PSHE and citizenship.
