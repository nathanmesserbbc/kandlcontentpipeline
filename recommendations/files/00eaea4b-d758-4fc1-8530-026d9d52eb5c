Isn't the internet totes amaze? The world is your wobbly mollusc. You can do so much incredible stuff with it, like share pictures of dogs in fancy dress with your pals and tweet your favourite celebs, but with great power comes great responsibility. 
 Here are some handy hints from me to help you successfully navigate the internet, without getting in loads of trouble. 
 	 It's less cool when a totes random from Twitter jumps out the shadows to meet you in person"
* Take time to understand the privacy settings on social media sites. If you don't, that Facebook event that you've created for your birthday (you know the one: cocktails and canap√©s for a select few) could end up in chaos, confusion and the local constabulary paying a visit to talk to your crying mum or landlord. 
 * Don't give people your location. Yes, it may be handy for your friends to come and find you on a night out, but it's less cool when a totes random from Twitter jumps out the shadows to meet you in person #you'rereallyprettyinreallife.
 * Giving your social media passwords to people is a no-no. Before you know it, your Facebook name's mysteriously changed to 'Sausage Lover McBoob Face' and you've sent out hilarious messages to all your mates.
 * Don't say stuff online that your boss might see. Tweeting 'totes skiving off today I'm rotten with a pinot grigio pox #yolo' might be a bit of a giveaway. It's all a massive chuckle until you find yourself laughing all the way to the job centre.
 * Please don't tweet horrible messages to people just because you've had a bad day or you don't agree with them on something. You'll get in serious trouble and you'll feel a totes idiot when it all blows up in your face. Hey, just relax, have a bath, have a brew, have some crisps, just step back from the darkness and don't do it. 
 * Don't get your difference out on your webcam. I know we've all been tempted. Your area might well be a beautiful sight to behold but you never know what might happen to those photos or videos, coz once something's on the internet, it's there for ever, ever, ever.
Those are my tips on how to be safe online. 
 Lots of love. For ever,
