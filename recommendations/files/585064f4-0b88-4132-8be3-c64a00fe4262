Bobby Gillespie, lead singer of Primal Scream, mourns the state of rock culture, saying it feels "kind of dead, it's over".
 Comparing it to television talent shows, Gillespie says rock music in Britain today "isn't any more dangerous than the X Factor".
 In an exclusive interview from BBC Four's Review Show, Gillespie discusses how the current music scene lacks the cultural importance it had in the 1960s and '70s.
 Gillespie formed Primal Scream with school friend Jim Beattie in Glasgow in 1982. He also played drums on The Jesus and Mary Chain's classic 1985 album Psychocandy, before leaving to concentrate on Primal Scream.
 His band found mainstream success with third album Screamadelica in 1991, thanks to the freeing up of their sound by producer Andy Weatherall. BBC Music described it as "both of its time yet quintessentially timeless". 
 Primal Scream's other defining release is XTRMNTR from 2000. The NME called it "the angriest, least compromised, most utterly justified pop record in years".
 Watch the full performance of It's Alright, It's OK from recent album More Light, recorded on The Review Show.
