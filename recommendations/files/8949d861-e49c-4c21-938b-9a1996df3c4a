 * Different kinds of school 
 	 Children learned reading, spelling, handwriting and arithmetic (mathematics). They were also taught history and geography. But the way they were taught was very different from today.
 The teacher wrote the lesson on the blackboard, using chalk. The children were expected to copy the lesson then memorise it. Pupils would chant their lesson out loud, word for word, from memory. Children who made mistakes in their copying or chanting faced strict punishments. 
 P.E. 'drill' lessons
 Pupils had P.E. lessons, known as 'drill'. Girls and boys marched on the spot and did simple stretches. To build up their strength, they swung large wooden clubs around. In some schools, boys were also given boxing lessons.
 In the afternoons, some schools taught crafts or trades that would be useful in later life, this would depend upon if you were a boy or a girl. Boys would learn carpentry, using saws, chisels, hammers, planes and drills to make useful things from wood. Girls learned how to sew and knit, how to cook and how to use a flat iron, heated on a stove, to get wrinkles out of newly washed clothes. At some schools, boys and girls were taught gardening.
 It was compulsory for children to go to school from Monday to Friday. On Sundays the church also ran lessons for an hour or two, these were not compulsory. At Sunday school, children sang hymns, or listened to Bible stories. Sometimes, they had an outing, such as a picnic, or a walk in the countryside.
