These classroom suggestions provide ways for pupils to actively imagine life at the time of World War One and to investigate the war's causes. 
 Pupils will have the opportunity to conduct their own research using primary source material.
 You could ask the children to use paints and large sheets of paper to make flags of the main European combatants (Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Germany and Austria-Hungary). Some children may enjoy finding out about and painting the individual flags of the states that made up the Austro-Hungarian Empire. 
 Encourage pupils to use books and websites to find out more about the history, colours and designs that appear on their flags. 
 Each pupil could write a brief, three-sentence 'story of the flag', perhaps using the formula: 'I am the flag of... My colours show... In 1914, I am part of the Triple Entente / Triple Alliance.' The children could go on to render their flag stories into the appropriate European language, using an online translation website. They might even use the website's pronunciation guide to learn their flag stories by heart, both in English and in translation.
 To help the children better understand the alliances that waged the war, they could each recite their flag stories, before Teachers' notes: Causes of war and the war yearsjoining together with the other in 'their' alliance and waving their combined flags. This will help pupils understand how alliances were made up of separate states joined together.

 This activity helps children to expand on the information about the causes of war given in the article. You'll need nine squares of paper, with one major cause of war written on each square. These labels might include: 
* 'Alliances: Triple Entente and Triple Alliance'
 * 'Germany wants a navy as big as Britain's'
 * 'Britain fears a strong Germany, so builds more warships'
 * 'Germany fears a strong Britain, so builds more warships'
 * 'Russia and France are allies, so Germany feels threatened on two sides'
 * 'Empires: France, Germany, Italy and Britain all want colonies'
 * 'A Serbian kills Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria'
 * 'France fears Germany will attack it'
 * 'Russia and Serbia are allies. They want to stop Austria-Hungary getting more powerful'.
Ask the children to read the 'Causes of war and the war years' article. Read out the label on each of your squares. The children could check any unfamiliar terms such as 'colony', 'empire' or 'alliance' in the library or using an online dictionary.
 Scatter the labelled squares on the floor. Invite individual pupils to arrange them into a diamond shape, with the 'most important' cause of war at the top of the diamond, followed by causes of lesser importance, until they arrive at the 'least important' cause at the bottom. Do others in the class agree with the arrangement? You could give every child a turn at arranging the decision diamond. Encourage pupils to discuss each arrangement, perhaps referring to the article to give reasons for their opinions. The class could vote on the final arrangement of the diamond.

 Pupils could create their own posters, perhaps working in small groups. 
 You could give each group a task, such as: 'persuade people to join the army' or 'keep everyone's spirits up'. Ask the children to create effective propaganda posters to fulfil their task. 
 There are plenty of online examples of wartime propaganda posters the children could use to fire their imaginations. 
 You could ask pupils to find out about the songs that helped to bolster Britain's morale in wartime. Recordings are easily found on internet video-sharing sites. The children could search for the following songs about soldiers going off to war: 
* 'Pack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit Bag'
 * 'Keep the Home Fires Burning'
 * 'Goodbye-ee'
 * 'Your King and Country Want You'
 * 'Goodbye Dolly Gray' (originally written at the time of the Boer War, but still a favourite in 1914)
The children could learn the songs and sing along with them. Some of these songs are well-suited to marching. Children might try marching in time to their singing. Which songs are best for marching? Which are the most cheerful and uplifting? Pupils could take a vote.

 You could give pupils the outline of a world map, along with a colour code or paint-by-numbers scheme. Ask the children to shade in the colonial territories of the main combatant nations, using the colour code. 
 Pupils could go on to find out from books or websites which of these territories played a part in the war. They could draw a 'war symbol' (of their own design on these locations, and add a note to show when each territory entered the war.
