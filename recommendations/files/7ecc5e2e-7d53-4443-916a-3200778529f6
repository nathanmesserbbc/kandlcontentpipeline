 You can take beautiful photos of the stars and Moon with a camera alone, but combining it with a telescope massively increases the possibilities. Even the cheapest telescope lets you enter a new realm of astrophotography. 
 Whether you have a compact, digital SLR or even a smartphone camera, you can take some stunning photos of planets, galaxies and nebulae with a basic telescope.
