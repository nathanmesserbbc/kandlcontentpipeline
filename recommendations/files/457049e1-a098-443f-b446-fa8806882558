* How did war end? 
 * Remembrance and poppies 
 * After the war 
 * Poetry 
 The war was so unusual and horrific that it inspired many people, especially soldiers, to write poems about it. 
 They wanted to describe what the war was like so that people at home could understand how it had felt for them. They also wanted to make sure people never forgot. These poems still exist and many people still read them today. 
 A British man called Rupert Brooke was one of the first war poets. 
 He was 26 when war began and he served in the Royal Navy. He was very patriotic and thought that it was very important to do your duty for your country. He thought war was sad but sometimes had to happen. 
 Brooke wrote several poems. One of his most famous poems was called 'The Soldier'. In it, he said, "If I should die, think only this of me: that there's some corner of a foreign field that is forever England". He meant that he was happy to fight and risk his life because he was doing it for his country. Whilst he was fighting, he was bitten by a mosquito. This caused an infection and he died in 1915.
 Another British soldier who wrote poems was Siegfried Sassoon. 
 Like Rupert Brooke, he fought for his country. However, he did not believe that war was necessary. He wrote poems that described how horrible the war was. 
 When his friend died fighting beside him in the war, he became angry and upset. He wrote in a poem called 'A Letter Home' that "war's a joke" and described it as "hell". He thought that it was wrong for humans to fight against each other. Wilfred Owen was another war poet who agreed with Siegfried's feelings about war.
