 Dogs were some of the hardest and most trusted workers in World War One. 
 The most popular dogs were medium-sized, like Doberman Pinschers and German Shepherds. They were very agile and their darker coats allowed them to slip unseen through the battlefield at night. 
 These dogs stayed with one soldier or guard and were taught to give a warning sound such as growling or barking when they sensed a stranger in the area or close to camp. Many Dobermans were also used as sentry dogs.
 These were dogs used to find the enemy. They were trained to be very quiet and well-behaved while they walked alongside soldiers patrolling the area. They could detect smells up to 1000 yards away which was much better than the sense of any man. Unlike sentry dogs they were trained not to bark as this would draw attention to the soldiers. Instead they would give a silent signal, like raising their tail, to let soldiers know that the enemy was on his way.
 These dogs were trained to find wounded or dying soldiers on the battlefield. They carried medical equipment so an injured soldier could treat himself and they would also stay beside a dying soldier to keep him company.
