 	 The Royal Family also had a big part to play in the war. During the war, the Royal Family decided to change its surname from 'Saxe-Coburg-Gotha' as they felt that it sounded too German. 
 The change of name also helped to show a separation of the Royal Family from their relations in Europe. George V was the first cousin of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany. He was also related in some way to virtually every royal family in Europe. The Royal Family changed their name to 'Windsor', which sounded more British. 
 Many people looked to the Royal Family, and especially King George V, to inspire them. They felt the Royal Family showed what it meant to be British and helped them to understand what they were fighting for. The new surname made this seem even more true. 
 Princess Mary worked with her mother, Queen Mary, to provide support and comfort for Britain's soldiers and sailors. 
 For Christmas 1914, she helped arrange for a tin containing tobacco or sweets, to be sent to every man in the armed forces.
 Edward, Prince of Wales, (later King Edward VIII), was banned by Lord Kitchener from taking part in the fighting in case he was captured by the German Army. 
 However he was allowed to serve in France as a Staff Officer and was later awarded the Military Cross.
 In 1918 he learned to fly but, once again, was not allowed to become involved in combat.
 Prince Albert, (later King George VI), served in the navy and army during World War One. 
 As he was not the heir to the throne at the time, he was not banned from taking part in combat.
