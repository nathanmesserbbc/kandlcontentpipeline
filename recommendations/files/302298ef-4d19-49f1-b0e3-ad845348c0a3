Victoria Coren Mitchell listens to the 'Poppins Tapes', which recorded the discussions between PL Travers and the Disney producers turning her novel Mary Poppins into a film.
 Walt Disney had pursued Travers for 15 years to make Mary Poppins, but she repeatedly rejected him as she was worried he would create a sentimentalised Disney version of her character.
 Disney won her over in 1959 with $100,000, five per cent of the film's profits, and script approval. She flew to America to meet Disney and critique the script, insisting that all her conversations at the studio be recorded on tape. 
 Discussions were tense, and the Poppins Tapes record the numerous disagreements.
