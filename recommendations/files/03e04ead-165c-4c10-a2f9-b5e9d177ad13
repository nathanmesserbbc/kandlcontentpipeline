Millions of soldiers died on the Western Front in World War One. The horrific stories and images from the frontline all reinforce the idea that fighting in the trenches was one long bloodbath. But statistics tell a different story. There were certainly days of great violence during four years of war â€“ such as the first day of the Battle of the Somme. But nearly 9 out of every 10 soldiers in the British Army, who went into the trenches, survived.
 The horrific death toll paints a picture of trench fighting as a four year long bloodbath. But the facts and figures tell a very different story. There were terrible days of grim violence when thousands of lives were lost, and half of all British soldiers on the Western Front sustained some kind of injury. But nearly 9 out of 10 British 'Tommies' survived the trenches. 
 How was this possible, considering that over 5 million British soldiers served on the Western Front? And when they weren't involved in an attack, what was everyday life like for the troops?
