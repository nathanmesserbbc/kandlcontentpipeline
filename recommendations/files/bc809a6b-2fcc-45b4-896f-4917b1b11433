 Britain was attacked from the sky for the first time ever at the start of 1915. 
 No one expected air raids, so when German airships first flew over Britain one dark night, the country was unprepared. The bombs they dropped were not very accurate, but still caused much injury and damage.
 In times to come, whistles would sound the alarm and people learnt to run for cover, taking shelter in the Underground, at home, in cellars or basements. For some, though, seeing an airship was very exciting and when one crashed, fragments were kept as souvenirs.
