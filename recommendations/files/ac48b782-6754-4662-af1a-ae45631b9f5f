The advance in human knowledge over the last two centuries has been astonishing.
 We pride ourselves on being rational creatures in a rational world.
 Cool logic and rational thought have brought us many new discoveries and great blessings but these are not the only faculties by which truth is discerned.

 Imagination, creative thinking and perceptive insight are all means by which elusive truth is grasped.
 Indeed, some of the greatest scientific discoveries were made less after logical thought and more after a great leap of imagination!
 A long Christian spiritual tradition encourages reflection on the gospel stories by imagining what it would have felt like to be there.
 The stories come to life by imagining the scene with noise and smells, and being sensitive to what those involved are feeling inside. 
 Inside Lent invites you to join this journey of discovery by firing your imagination and reflecting on what things like, temptation, fear, and love feel like to you inside.
 The 2014 features on BBC Local Radio Sunday Breakfast shows and the services on BBC Radio 4's Sunday Worship will explore the topic "Inside Lent", beginning on Sunday 9 March.
