Love is universal but love is also complex.
 The Greeks used several words to describe different kinds of love expressed, for example in friendship, romance or family love.
 Exercises and Readings
* Take 10 minutes to relax and reflect on your love for someone special to you. What does it feel like inside?
 * Reflect on a time when you felt most loved. Can you describe what that means to you?
 * What ways have you found to 'love your neighbour as yourself'?
 * Can you remember an occasion when a friend or stranger, generously and unselfishly, came to your help? What did that feel like?
 * What does it mean to claim that Agape is not an emotion but a principle of the Christian way?
 On occasion, as with a mother and her child, the feeling of love can be overwhelming. A mother will go to any lengths even sacrificing her own good in order to protect and nurture her child. Some have seen in that love a glimpse of what the love of God might be.
 In the world of evolution it is not hard to see why such love is so vital for the survival of the species.
 From very early days Christians took the Greek word agape to mean the selfless, unconditional love that gives yet desires nothing in return.
 In terms of evolution this kind of love might seem to defy logic yet intuitively it is sensed to be at the heart of what it is to be human.
 Isaiah paints a vivid picture of God as a mother who comforts her children. If the love of a human mother can be so overwhelmingly strong how much more must be the love of God.
 Elsewhere, God is likened to the mother who teaches, holds, heals and feeds her young.
 One principle of evolution, competition and the survival of the fittest, is sometimes taken to justify all manner of greed and exploitation. But that principle is only part of the picture. 
 In order to live and flourish mutual co-operation and selfless giving are also vital to human survival. "As you wish others would do to you, do so to them."
 It may well appear counter-intuitive to "love your enemies and do good to those who hate you" and indeed it may seem foolish, even impossible to try.
 But then there was a time when people believed it was impossible for anyone to run a mile in under four minutes. Once that barrier was breached others poured through to push back the boundaries to achievement.
 Selfless, unconditional love enshrined in the word "agape" may appear foolish and seem impossible but for the fact that it is embodied, God's love, in the life of Jesus Christ. Where he led others followed and changed the world.
 Gracious God, slow to anger and of great kindness, Jesus, as a mother you gather your people to you.
 You are gentle with us as a mother with her children.
 Often you weep over our sin and our pride, tenderly you draw us from hatred and judgement.
 Lord Jesus, in your mercy heal us, in your love and tenderness re-make us.
 And for the beauty of heaven may your love prepare us. 
 (St.Anselm. 1033 - 1109)
