 On the Western Front, the war was fought in trenches. 
 Trenches were long, narrow ditches dug into the ground where soldiers lived all day and night. 
 There were many lines of German trenches on one side and many lines of Allied trenches on the other. 
 In the middle, was No Man's Land, so-called because it did not belong to either army. Soldiers crossed No Man's Land when they wanted to attack the other side.
 Soldiers in the trenches did not get much sleep. When they did, it was in the afternoon during daylight and at night only for an hour at a time. They were woken up at different times, either to complete one of their daily chores or to fight. During rest time, they wrote letters and sometimes played card games. 
 The trenches could be very muddy and smelly. There were many dead bodies buried nearby and the latrines (toilets) sometimes overflowed into the trenches. Millions of rats infested the trenches and some grew as big as cats. There was also a big problem with lice that tormented the soldiers on a daily basis.
