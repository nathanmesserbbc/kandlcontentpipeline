Glasgow International 2014 sees an array of contemporary artists arrive in Glasgow, drawn by the city's formidable reputation as a fertile place for visual art. These artists will take over the city, utilising nooks, crannies and galleries showcase work including paintings, sculptures, installations and video work.
 We follow London based artist Alistair Frost as he embarks on an ambitious project for this year's Glasgow International. He turns a disused space in the city's Saltmarket into a nail bar where members of the public can have his specially created art work applied to their nails.
 He explains: "I started off making these shows that were to do with bars, and the idea of the 'art opening'. That has evolved through shows that were about leisure and spa activity - I did a show with a sauna.
 "This idea of where art butts up against leisure - the nail bar seemed like a segue from that, but also seemed like something I could get my teeth into in terms of how the motif is distributed."
