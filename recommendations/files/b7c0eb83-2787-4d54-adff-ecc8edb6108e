The Wars of the Roses were brought to a dramatic conclusion at the Battle of Bosworth Field as Henry Tudor claimed Richard III's crown. It was an end to decades of bloody civil war between the white and red roses of York and Lancaster. But what became of Elizabeth Woodville, Elizabeth of York, Thomas Stanley, Margaret Beaufort and Henry Tudor?
 By the time of Henry's accession to the throne, Elizabeth Woodville, the White Queen, had left sanctuary with her daughters after submitting to Richard III. She had, too, encouraged Thomas Grey, a son borne with her first husband Sir John Grey, to abandon Henry Tudor and return home. Henry's subsequent success in deposing Richard illustrated the extent of her miscalculation.

 Though there were no immediate penalties imposed, her dower lands were transferred to her daughter, Elizabeth of York, in 1487. She retreated to Bermondsey Abbey, where she died in 1492. With no material wealth to leave behind in her will, she left her daughters her blessing and was buried beside Edward IV at St George's Chapel in Windsor.
 Before losing at the battle of Bosworth it was rumoured that Richard III was planning to marry his niece Elizabeth himself, though Richard had issued a public denial on the matter. Henry Tudor's victory removed any uncertainty. Elizabeth married Henry in January 1486 and they had their first child, Arthur, later that year. Her coronation took place the following year and she was crowned, like her mother before her, Queen of England.

 Though the fact of her marriage to the king was a hugely important political symbol in validating Henry's claim, she was not notably politically active herself. Her mother-in-law, Margaret Beaufort, wielded far greater political influence. Indeed, a Spanish observer was to note of Elizabeth that "she is kept in subjection by the mother of the king". She bore the king eight children, but by the time of her own death in 1503, only three were still alive.
 Before Richard III's death, Margaret Beaufort found herself in a precarious position. She was involved with the failed Buckingham Rebellion of 1483, which had sought to remove Richard from the throne. As a result her property was handed over to her husband, Lord Thomas Stanley. He was also charged with her safe custody and it was only Stanley's loyalty to the king at the time which saved her life.

 With the victory of her son, Henry Tudor, at Bosworth, came a total reversal of Maragaret Beaufort's fortunes. The first parliament of Henry's reign established Margaret's legal independence from her husband. Her inherited lands were again redistributed between them and she was to remain an influential political figure throughout Henry's reign. She lived to see the Tudor dynasty secured as Henry VIII acceded to the throne two months before her death, in 1509.
 The betrayal of Richard by Thomas Stanley and his brother William at Bosworth was decisive in swinging the battle in Henry's favour. William Stanley's men cut down Richard, whilst it is claimed that Thomas placed his crown on Henry's head. This intervention brought rewards with it.

 In October 1485 Thomas was made earl of Derby and the following year confirmed as constable of England. His assistance in quashing an armed rising in Stoke in 1487 and again in Yorkshire in 1489 saw further lands bestowed upon him. William, however, was executed for treason in 1495 after conspiring against the King. Thomas died in Lathom, Lancashire, in July 1504 and was buried at Burscough Priory.
 Despite his victory over Richard, Henry's grip on power was far from secure. His marriage to Elizabeth of York in 1486 united the red and white roses of Lancaster and York but plots and conspiracies persisted. The uncertainty surrounding the fate of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville's sons, the 'Princes in the tower', added to his insecurity. Pretenders to the throne were a thorn in Henry's side. One, Perkin Warbeck, masqueraded as Richard duke of York, the younger of the two princes, and was executed. Another, Lambert Simnel, was spared death and put to work in the Royal kitchens.

 Henry's youngest son, Edmund, died in 1500. His eldest son and heir, Arthur, died in 1502; his wife the following year, just nine days after a new daughter, Catherine, was also lost. Another son Henry, however, survived and it was agreed that he would marry his brother Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon. Henry VII, the first Tudor king, died from tuberculosis in 1509. The peaceful accession to the throne of his son, Henry VIII, bore testament to his success in establishing a dynasty.
