 The British Empire
 The British Empire included all the territories (countries) that were ruled by Britain. By the 1900s it was the largest empire in history controlling a quarter of the world's surface and more than 400 million people.
 A classroom during World War One was bare and simple. There were just a few books, as most learning was done straight from the blackboard. 
 There was no carpet. On the walls there might be just a map of the world, showing the British Empire shaded in pink or red, and portraits of King George V and Queen Mary. 
 Pupils learning to write used a slate with a squeaky, chalky 'slate pencil'. The writing came out white against the dark background. Children spat on the slate to rub out any mistakes they had made.
 Older children wrote in exercise books known as 'copybooks'. They used wooden pens with metal points (or 'nibs') which they dipped again and again into inkwells made of china. An inkwell was a little pot of ink that hung in a hole cut in the desk. It was tricky to write neat, joined-up handwriting without making smudges or blots!
