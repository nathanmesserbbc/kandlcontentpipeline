Almost a million men from Britain and her Empire were killed during the First World War – a devastating statistic for which Britain's wartime military leaders have borne the brunt of the blame.
 The stereotype is that the ordinary soldiers were lions led by donkeys – the donkeys being incompetent, uncaring generals, responsible for thousands of unnecessary deaths.

They faced situations that no British military leader had ever encountered before. And ultimately, they delivered victory for Britain and her allies. So has history misjudged the generals of World War One?
