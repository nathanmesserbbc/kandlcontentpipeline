Dylan Thomas is famous for his masterful wordplay and colourful private life. But his work as a scriptwriter during World War Two, penning powerful propaganda films in support of the war effort, is less well-known.
 It is not surprising that Thomas was attracted to working in the film industry. He had an early love of film, inspired by his childhood visits to the Uplands cinema in Swansea. In fact, one of his first published works was an essay on film in his school magazine.
 However, when you explore his personal beliefs, it becomes clear that he was unlikely to involve himself in the war effort willingly. It was only as the war progressed that circumstances forced him into becoming part of Britain's wartime propaganda machine.
