 Sergeant Stubby was a dog, born in America during 1916 or 1917 when the war was already going on. Stubby went on to become a very brave soldier and won a lot of medals before he reached the age of two.
 Nobody knows exactly when Stubby was born, but he was found in Connecticut in the United States of America. 
 Like most dogs of his breed, Stubby was fairly small. He was around 16 inches tall and weighed about eight kilograms. He had a black nose and big, round, dark eyes. His legs were straight and muscular and his coat was brown and white. He also had a short, stubby tail. He was alert, polite and excitable. 
 He loved exercise and training and was very friendly.
 In 1917, Stubby wandered across an army training session at Yale Field in Connecticut. He made friends with all of the soldiers. 
 One soldier especially liked him. His name was Corporal Robert Conroy. Conroy named him Stubby because of his short tail. 
 The USA joined the war in this year and Conroy had to go and fight. He really did not want to leave Stubby behind and smuggled him onto the ship taking him to France. 
 Stubby was taken all the way to the Western Front, right into the middle of all the fighting.
