 Jack didn't stay working as a delivery boy for long, because war was on its way.
 In August 1914 World War One began. The war changed everyone's plans. At once thousands of men volunteered to join the Army or the Navy. 
 Jack's father Eli was an ex-soldier. Although probably over 50 years old, Eli joined the Army again, and went to France.
 Jack wanted to fight too. But he wanted to be a sailor.
 In 1914 Britain had the world's biggest navy. Britain 'ruled the waves', and many people were proud of the Royal Navy. Pictures of battleships - the navy's biggest war ships - and sailors in their jaunty blue bell-bottom (flared) trousers could be seen everywhere. 
 To Jack, the Navy seemed more exciting than the Army. Many boys dreamed of going to sea in mighty warships, and having adventures. Jack was just the same.
 When Jack first tried to join the Royal Navy, he was turned away. He was too young. 
 In July 1915 he tried again. Without his parents' permission, he gave the names of his boss at work and his old headmaster as referees. He was accepted.
 Jack was sent to Devonport near Plymouth for training. He learned to work as part of a ship's crew, and to obey orders. He was trained as a gun layer or 'sight setter', helping to aim the guns at a target. 
 A warship gun had a team of sailors, each with his own job. Jack's job was to help aim the gun and pass on orders.
