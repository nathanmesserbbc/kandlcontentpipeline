 	 Women drivers from the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY) went to France and drove ambulances across battlefields. 
 In 1914 the FANYs served with the Belgian army. 
 Lady Dorothie Feilding became an ambulance driver in 1914, after a month's first-aid training in hospital. 
 She was sent to Flanders in Belgium, where some of the worst battles were being fought. She wrote home, describing the poppies in the fields and her pet dog, Charles. 
 Lady Dorothie was the first woman to be awarded the Military Medal for bravery. She received her medal from the King in 1916 and worked as an ambulance driver until 1917, when she came home to get married. 
 Lady Dorothie lost two of her three brothers during the war, one killed at the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and one in Flanders in 1917.
