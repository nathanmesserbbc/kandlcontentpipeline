Danny Baker takes us on a tour of some of the musical 'bits and pieces' from his life as a music journalist, television &amp; radio presenter and record shop employee.
 Danny took some time out from recording Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades, to open up his record box. He reveals music-related treasure picked up at street markets and elsewhere. We hear what friend and fellow record shop worker Elton John had to say in a personal message scrawled inside an LP, and how Danny procured a (used) ticket for the Woodstock Festival.
 Other acts who feature include Nick Drake, David Bowie, Elvis Costello, The Beatles, The Clash and The Sex Pistols.
 Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades begins with The Seventies on BBC Four, Monday 10 February at 9pm. The Eighties and Nineties follow on 11 &amp; 12 February at the same time. In each programme Danny and guests, including Adam Buxton, Loyd Grossman, Peter Hook and Josie Long, debate the merits, and recount their own experiences, of those years.
 Also on 10 February on BBC Four, at 10.30pm, Danny Baker Rocks the Seventies (A Bit) showcases rare performance footage from that decade. 1980s and '90s compilations follow at 10pm on 11 &amp; 12 February.
