 * Different kinds of school 
 	 Schools provided children from poorer families a basic education and they would attend either a board school or a school run by the church.
 Most children at board schools in the early 1900s did not have uniforms, they just wore their ordinary clothes. It was only in the 1920s that board schools began asking their pupils to wear uniforms.
 At some schools, known as 'industrial schools', boys learned skills such as baking, print-making or shoe-making, to help them find a job. Industrial schools did have uniforms for their pupils.
 The law said children had to stay at school until they were at least 12 years old. After that, children from poor families usually had to leave and go out to work. The school leaving age was raised in 1918, the last year of the war. All children then had to stay at school until they were at least 14. Some richer children were educated by a governess or a tutor at home. Many rich girls continued their education at home and never went to school.
 Public schools
 Pupils from public schools wore smart uniforms.
 Children from poor families who did well at academic subjects could take an exam to win a 'scholarship'. This would pay for a place at a grammar school, where they could be taught to a higher standard. These schools also took pupils from families who could afford to pay for a place and a uniform.
 'Public schools' had uniforms, too. These were for the richest families and charged parents money for their children's education. Pupils often lived at school, only going home for the holidays. Public schools concentrated on sport and on preparing their pupils to lead the country. Many public schoolboys went on to be officers in World War One.
