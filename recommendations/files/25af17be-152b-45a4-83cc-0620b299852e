 Even though food was very short in Britain during World War One, families often sent parcels to their fathers and brothers fighting at the front. The parcels contained presents of chocolate, cake, tobacco and tinned food. 
 At the beginning of the war, soldiers got just over one pound of meat, the same amount in bread and eight ounces of vegetables each day. 
 Some soldiers worked in field kitchens which were set up just behind the trenches to cook meals for the soldiers who were fighting. 
 By 1917 the official ration for the average British 'Tommy' was much smaller. Fresh meat was getting harder to come by and the ration was reduced to just 6 ounces of 'bully beef' (which we call corned beef today). Soldiers on the actual front line got even less meat and vegetables than this. 
 'Maconchie's meat stew' and hard biscuits was a meal that many soldiers ate. Sadly, the meat was mostly fat. This, along with a shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables, was responsible for many soldiers to suffer from upset stomachs!
