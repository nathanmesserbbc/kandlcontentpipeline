 The police had plenty to do during the war. As well as solving crimes, catching criminals and keeping order, they hunted for enemy spies trying to steal secrets. Most German spies were quickly arrested. 
 There were men and women police officers and they made sure people obeyed the new wartime rules such as not showing lights at night from windows which might have helped guide an attack from the air. 
 Police patrolled railways, docks and canals to keep war transport moving and prevent sabotage (where important things were destroyed to help the enemy).
 One of the police officers' duties was to patrol the streets to make sure people's homes were properly covered up during black-outs. If a house was found to have a 'light infringement' the owner would be fined. In 1914, Britons saw women patrolling the streets for the first time as part of the Women's Police Volunteers. They were not there to catch criminals but their role was to make sure women acted 'properly'.
 If Britain were ever to be invaded, the police were prepared to perform special emergency duties. These included taking old and sick people to places of safety, as well as destroying rail lines, bridges and food supplies to stop the enemy. 
 Britain's network of canals allowed canal boats to move goods around the country, but by the mid-1800s canal boats were helped by new trains and railways.
 There were three different classes of travel - third class was the cheapest and had uncomfortable wooden seats. The growth of the rail network meant that food prices fell as farmers could get their products to market quicker and cheaper.
 When World War One began, the railway was the main way for men, munitions and supplies to be transported to where they were needed. Lots of men who worked on the railways volunteered for military service. This meant there would not be enough men left to help build and look after the railways to help in the war effort. 
 Men were chosen from the Royal Engineers (the 'Sappers') to help with this work. In Kent, a whole new port was built to help send supplies across the English Channel to France. The men built a 'roll-on, roll-off' ferry that could carry tanks made in factories at home to the British army in France.
 The Army Service Corps was part of the British army and looked after transporting food, water, fuel, equipment, clothing and horses but not ammunition or military equipment. 
 Many worked in railway depots (a large storage or warehouse area where supplies were kept) or on trains taking supplies to soldiers on the frontline. 
 In 1918, the corps became the Royal Army Service Corps for its service in World War One.
 Ambulance trains were used to take the wounded to hospital. A typical ambulance train could carry up to 400 patients in one of its sixteen carriages equipped with beds and stretchers, a pharmacy, two kitchens and a stores van. It carried the usual train crew that included the driver, guard and stoker and there would be cooks, doctors, nurses and pharmacists (chemists) to look after the patients. There would be men ready to load and unload them at the various pick up ports, stations and hospital destinations.
