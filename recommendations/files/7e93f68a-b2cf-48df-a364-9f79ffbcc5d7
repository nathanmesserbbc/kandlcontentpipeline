 When the war ended Caroline wanted new challenges.

* The first dishwashers were worked by hand. Electric versions were made in the 1920s. 
 * The first electric washing machine appeared in 1907. 
 * Electric hairdryers went on sale in the 1920s. Before then, women dried their hair with a towel or in front of the fire.
 In 1919, Caroline joined the new Women's Engineering Society and became its secretary, writing letters and organising meetings. One of her jobs was to edit (plan and produce) a magazine called 'The Woman Engineer'. 
 There was much to teach people about electricity. Britain did not yet have a 'national grid' of power stations sending electricity into homes.
 In 1922 Caroline asked women which new appliances would be most useful in the home. The most popular suggestion was a machine to wash the dishes followed by a vacuum cleaner. It showed what many women wanted: less time spent on tiring and repetitive household chores. 
 In 1924 Caroline Haslett became head of the new Electrical Association for Women; it soon had 10,000 members. Women found out more through lectures, magazines and books such as 'The Electrical Handbook for Women'. They learned safety rules about electricity, how to fit a plug and how to put in new wires for lights. Days out included visits to power stations to see how electricity was produced. 
 After World War One, many working women returned to family life at home but others chose independent careers. In 1925, a newspaper article about 'career women' featured Caroline. While flat-sharing in London (then quite a rare thing for women) she showed herself to be a good role model for other young women. Caroline and her flatmate did their own electrical wiring and this was the start of her great interest in making women's lives at home easier. 
 The government started to listen to Caroline. She wanted better science education for girls. She wanted women to be asked about new electric appliances and, better still, to design them. Were they safe? Easy to use? She wanted women to know how electricity was made and about new inventions such as television (first broadcast by the BBC in Britain in 1936).
