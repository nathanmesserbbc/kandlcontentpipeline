* Before the war 
 * School dinners 
 * Home front food 
 From 1906, many schools served a midday dinner. These were solid, heavy, belly-filling meals, with plenty of stodge.
 What's on the menu?
* bean soup and bread, followed by treacle pudding
 * toad-in-the-hole, potatoes and bread
 * mutton stew and suet pudding
 * fish and potato pie, followed by baked raisin pudding.
In 1914, around 14 million dinners were dished up in British schools. But that still meant around half the schools in the land did not serve a meal at all. 
 When war came, food began to run short. Schools, like everyone else, had to cut back on what they served. Charities began to open soup kitchens, where children (and grown-ups) could get a hot meal. They served cheap food such as pea soup, fried fish, or oatmeal and onion pudding. 
 A war-time newsreel showed the Prime Minister's wife, Mrs Lloyd George, opening one of these 'National Kitchens', as they were called. Outside, a huge queue of hungry people could be seen waiting to be fed.
