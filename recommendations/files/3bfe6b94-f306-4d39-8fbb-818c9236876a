 * Remembering Jack 
 Jack's story was told in newspapers, magazines and books. 
 He became a national hero. He was first buried in a 'common grave' with other casualties (people who have been injured or killed), but in July 1916 at Manor Park Cemetery, Jack's body was reburied after a military funeral, including a parade through the streets. 
 Photos of the new hero were scarce. One newspaper photo published as Jack was actually of one of his brothers .
 HMS Chester's captain wrote to Jack's mother, telling her Jack's 'devotion to duty was an example for all of us'. 
 Jack's brother Arthur was killed in action in 1918. Sickness as well as battle wounds killed many soldiers in World War One, and Jack's father died in 1916, of bronchitis. Jack's mother died in 1919.
 Jack Cornwell became a war hero for 'doing his duty'. During World War One, his picture appeared everywhere, on collectors' cards, packaging and posters. An artist painted Jack beside his gun, using another of Jack's brothers as a model. 
 Today Jack is still remembered, for his courage, and as one of the youngest winners of the Victoria Cross. 
 A school, a community centre and a street are named after him. There is a Cornwell Award for Scouts. Jack's gun can be seen at the Imperial War Museum in London. Jack's sister Alice presented his medal to the museum. 
 Jack Cornwell VC has become part of our history.
