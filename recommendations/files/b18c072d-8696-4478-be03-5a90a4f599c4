 * Hero or criminal? 
 Edith Cavell was born on 4 December 1865, in the village of Swardeston in Norfolk, England.
 Her father, Fredrick, was a vicar. Edith was the eldest child. She had a brother, John, and two sisters, Lillian and Florence. 
 As a vicar, Edith's father did not earn a lot of money but he gave as much as he could to the poor. Edith helped him to raise money for a Sunday school. 
 As a Christian, Edith learnt from both the Bible and her father's teaching that it was important to help people. This was one of the things that inspired her to become a nurse.
 When she was very young, she drew pictures of birds and flowers. Local people who liked her pictures donated money which helped raise Â£300 for the school. Edith was not just a talented artist, she was also very good at French.
 "
 Some day, somehow, I am going to do something useful. I don't know what it will be. I only know that it will be something for people. They are, most of them, so helpless, so hurt and so unhappy."
In 1890, Edith moved to Belgium to become a governess (home teacher) for a French family. 
 She also travelled to Austria where she learned about a free hospital that helped the sick without asking for money. 
 She was very impressed by this. 
 She returned to England when her father became ill so she could help him recover.
