 Most children ate porridge, and bread and butter or margarine, with jam. Some children liked bread and dripping - the fat that 'dripped' from meat as it cooled, or a bacon sandwich. 
 Toast took longer, without an electric toaster. Cereals such as cornflakes were not as popular as they are now, but people could buy them at the grocer's. Many adults liked to start the day with eggs and bacon, or smoked fish called kippers. Eggs and bacon were easier to get in the country as many people -rich and poor- often kept chickens or sometimes a pig.
 Burgers, pizzas and hot dogs were not World War One treats. No-one in Britain knew about them. When people stopped for a snack in the street, it was more likely to be a bag of roasted chestnuts, a meat pie, a dish of cooked, snakelike fish called jellied eels, or a saveloy (a kind of sausage). Fish and chips were the most popular takeaway. There were lots of caf√©s where people could buy a cup of tea and a sandwich or a bun, or have a cheap meal.
 Very few people owned a refrigerator or freezer, which were 'new-fangled luxuries' from America. Shops did not sell frozen foods. People could buy tinned peas, or dried peas that had to be soaked in water. Fresh peas in their pods were only on sale when the pea-picking season came around each summer. It was the same with most other vegetables, but people could buy potatoes all year round.
 Rich people might look forward to oysters or steak or smoked salmon in a restaurant, or even a tasty French dish such as chicken cooked in wine. Poorer people could afford meat only once a week, and made it last as long as they could. Pies and stews, using cheap cuts of meat and vegetables, were popular. Fish was cheap too. Many people were fond of buns, chocolate, cakes and biscuits. Favourite dishes for some were tripe (made from cows' stomachs) and onions or boiled pigs' trotters (feet).
 Sweet shops sold all kinds of sweets, such as bull's-eyes, gobstoppers and strips of liquorice. You could get 4 liquorice strips for a penny, and a bottle of ginger beer as well. A penny was a week's pocket money for most children. Some ginger beer bottles had glass marble stoppers children used to play with after they'd drunk the ginger beer. Many shopkeepers made their own sweets, and sold them (four sweets for a halfpenny) in a twist of paper.
