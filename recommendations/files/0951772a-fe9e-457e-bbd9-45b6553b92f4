 These assembly packs, on the themes of remembrance, commemoration and peace, aim to help students reflect on the 2014 centenary of World War One. 
 They suggest ways in which students can assess the impact of the war on history and also explore how remembrance, commemoration and peace have become part of national life in the UK and other countries. 
 Each theme includes an assembly script for teachers, along with classroom ideas and suggestions for further research. There are media resources too, including image galleries, video clips and audio clips.
