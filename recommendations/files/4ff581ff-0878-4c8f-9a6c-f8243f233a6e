In 1969 the world watched as three men set foot on the Moon. For the first time, man had ventured out of the planet we call home and touched the possibility of worlds beyond.
 But our space travel ambitions seem to have stalled since the 1970s and 1980s. In over thirty years, we've ventured virtually no further than the original pioneers. And as more astronauts have spent more time aboard the various space stations, they have reported worrying health problems. Humans didn't evolve to cope with the strange conditions of space. So other than the obvious peril of launching a human off our planet with huge rockets, could there be something about space which is inherently hazardous to our health?
