 	 A well-dressed man in the early 1900s wore a suit with a jacket. For formal occasions he would wear a black or grey knee-length jacket, called a 'morning coat' or 'frock coat.' He teamed this with striped trousers and shiny leather boots. His shirt had a 'wing collar' that stood up stiffly around his neck, so he had to hold his head up at all times.
 To keep warm, he wore a waistcoat under his jacket. He kept a pocket watch in one pocket of his waistcoat and wore the watch chain across his stomach.
 Glossary
 His outfit was completed by a dark coloured cravat tied around his collar, or a tie similar to those worn today. When outside, he wore a bowler hat and carried a walking stick. Top hats were worn for formal or important occasions. 
 In summer he might change his outfit for a stripy blazer and a flat, round, straw hat called a 'boater'. A sporting man might wear a short tweed jacket, called a 'Norfolk jacket', along with 'plus-fours', knee-length baggy tweed shorts.
 Flat caps and bowler hats
 Working men wore flat caps with peaks. They would touch their caps, or take off their hats to greet people in the street. 
 Round-topped 'bowler' hats were beginning to catch on as well.
 But fashions were changing, shorter jackets and turn-down shirt collars were beginning to catch on. By the end of the war, frock coats, wing collars and top hats were seen as very old-fashioned.
 Working men wore short jackets, baggy, dark trousers, shirts without collars and waistcoats. On their heads, they wore flat caps with peaks. They did not wear their hats indoors, and took them off in church, as a sign of respect.
 Men in Queen Victoria's time often had long hair and beards or whiskers. By 1914, it was fashionable for men to have short hair. Many of them shaved off their beards or kept a shorter beard with a moustache. Some men sported handle bar moustaches with waxed ends.
