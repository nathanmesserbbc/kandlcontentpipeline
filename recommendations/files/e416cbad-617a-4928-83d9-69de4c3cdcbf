We've all used the phrase 'rocket science' to mean something extremely complicated. But when you break down the ideas behind it, it's really pretty simple.
 Firing rockets into space is all about overcoming the force of gravity. We face that same challenge whether we're launching a NASA mission into space or firing a homemade rocket in the park. 
 So using three types of model that you can make yourself, we'll launch some of our own mini-rockets. By understanding how these small-scale examples work, we'll be able to see some of the underlying principles used by experts who build real-life space rockets.
