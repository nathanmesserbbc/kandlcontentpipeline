Later conflicts are also considered.\n The children are reminded of why the slaughter came as such a shock to people in the war years. The assembly materials ask pupils to think about what we mean by peace, patriotism and pacifism. The assembly examines the role of international peacemakers, as well as the peace movement, in the light of the commemoration of the World War One's centenary.\n Children will have an opportunity to think about the impact of war and peace on modern history. They will be invited to consider why some people think remembrance ceremonies glorify war and why others say such commemoration helps us to value peace, by reminding us of the sacrifices made, particularly in the world wars of the twentieth century. \n The assembly materials include a script for teachers, along with classroom ideas and suggestions for further research. There are online resources too, including a video clip.\n The assembly's message is that what happened in the past can still affect us now. To hope for peace is not enough to achieve it. The soldiers who fought in the trenches in 1914 - 1918 are now all dead, but their experiences live on in archive audio and video recordings. The fallen of World War One remain graphic witnesses to history. \n The assembly offers an introduction to study topics in history, English, RE, PSHE and citizenship.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"World War One Primary Assembly - Peace - Introduction","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
