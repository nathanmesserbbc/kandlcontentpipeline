Before World War One, there were not many munitions factories but with the onset of the war Britain realised it was going to need a lot more shells and bullets. In 1915 there was a 'shell crisis', it became so bad that British guns were only allowed to fire four shells a day.\n Lloyd George, who was the head of a new Ministry of Munitions, decided that Britain needed to find a way to make more shells for the British Forces on the front line. New munitions factories were quickly built to make the much needed shells. \n Men worked as labourers building the new factories while others worked in the factories making the munitions. However, there were not enough men to do all the work so women were brought in, in their thousands, to work in the factories. Normally there was a male foreman who would teach the women workers new skills such as how to operate a lathe (a machine that holds, turns and cuts metal). \n Other men would work heavy machinery such as a cutting machine or a screw-turning machine. Some of the men worked in the offices organising the transport of the shells to where they were needed. \n Before the war, the growth of the British Empire meant Britain needed lots of ships, railways and canals to bring and take goods, people and food exports to and from Britain. Factories made the steel needed to build the transport and transport networks. Britain had also started to make more cars and trucks which also needed a plentiful supply of steel.\n With the outbreak of war in 1914 there was an even greater demand for steel to make shells, bullets, tanks, ships, submarines and aeroplanes. \n Steel workers would work in the 'smelting shops' which contained open hearth furnaces (huge open ovens). Others would work in cogging mills rolling out the hot steel into plates for ships and shells. They might operate huge guillotines (a machine with a strong blade) to cut the metal into large pieces. \n Because the war caused such a huge growth in the steel industry, many men who might have gone to fight in the war stayed at home to work as steelworkers, engineers and builders.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The different types of factory roles men had during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
