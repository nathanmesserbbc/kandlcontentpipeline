For many of those lucky enough to return, the wounds they had suffered in Europe would leave them permanently disfigured.\n The trenches protected the bodies of soldiers, but in doing so it left their heads vulnerable to enemy fire. Soldiers would frequently stick their heads up above the trenches, exposing them to all manner of weapons.\n At the start of the war, little consideration was given to the trauma of facial injuries.
