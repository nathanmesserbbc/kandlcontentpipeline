Television hadn't been invented. \n The army had radios, but no one at home had a radio they could switch on to listen to the news. There were no computers, so no computer games. People of all ages, rich or poor, made their own amusements - playing games, singing, listening to music and reading. \n Many families wanted a record player called a gramophone to listen to music. Soldiers had gramophones too, even in the trenches. The records broke easily, so people were very careful with them - they put them on a turntable, wound up the gramophone and gently placed a metal needle on the record to play it. A large shell-like trumpet made the music louder. \n Many families kept a cat, which besides being a pet was useful in chasing away mice and rats. Dogs were probably the most popular pet, as they are today. Even soldiers at the front had dogs as pets. People kept canaries (singing birds) and pigeons too, and in the country children often made pets of lambs, piglets and chicks. Rich children living in the country usually had ponies to ride, or even drove small carts pulled by a goat or donkey. \n Rich children had some wonderful toys, such as doll's houses, rocking horses and steam trains that puffed out real steam. Poor children made do with home-made or cheap toys. Boys and girls liked bowling hoops - boys usually had iron ones whilst girls had wooden versions. Children played marbles too. There were big shiny marbles called alleys, and little ones called plimsolls. Children liked hopscotch, skipping, playing football with a tennis ball, and playing conkers in the autumn. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at typical families during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How people entertained themselves during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
