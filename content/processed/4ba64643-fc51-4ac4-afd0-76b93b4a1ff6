Despite setbacks to their campaign, Caroline believed women would win in the end.\n At 18, Caroline went to college in London where she learned office skills such as typing. In 1914 she got her first job as a clerk with the Cochran Company, working in the office. It was just what she enjoyed - an engineering firm which made boilers.\n What is a boiler?\n Every steam engine has a boiler where water is heated to make steam. The steam then drives the engine's moving parts. Cochran's 'upright boilers' were sold all over the world. They were in ships steaming along the Amazon River in South America and on ocean liners crossing the sea. Many factories had them too. \n Boiler-making was so important to the war effort that in 1914 the government took control of the Cochran factories. Caroline was kept busy making sure orders and materials got to the right place at the right time. \n The Cochran Company was known for treating its workers fairly. Caroline's bosses soon realised how good she was at her job and by 1918, Caroline was in charge of the London office. Later she was sent to learn more about the business at its boiler works in Scotland. The workmen there were surprised to meet a young woman so interested in engineering.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas on the life and work of Caroline Haslett during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Caroline's work and how she helped in the war","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
