You don't need the supernatural. \n \"Hope is an attitude to the future. The future is an unknown and you can take a scientific attitude to prophesy the likely future.\"\n \"Hope is not something that you have evidence for - it's something that you feel in you.\"\n Aaqil Ahmed, commissioning editor of Religion &amp; Ethics at the BBC, has high hopes for the Dawkins-Sacks debate: \"Jonathan and Richard are two of Britains most revered thinkers in this area,\" he said. \n \"I can't wait to listen to them explore the complexities of the relationship between religion and science.\n \"This is a chance to see in the flesh if the gaps between these two worlds can be bridged by possibly the only two people who could manage it.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Richard Dawkins and Jonathan Sacks will take part in a debate on science and religion at the Re:Think festival in Salford.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
