By June 1918, it had spread around the world. \n It was called \"the greatest enemy of all\" because it infected about half of the world's population. 40-50 million people died of this illness - many more people than the war itself. \n What was to blame?\n At the time, people were not sure what had caused the outbreak of the flu. Some thought it might be caused by poison gas. Today we know it developed in animals and birds then spread to people. Influenza spread all around the world on ships trading goods with other countries. The war helped it to spread because more people than usual were travelling. Soldiers also lived very closely together in camps and trenches and this helped the influenza to spread more easily.\n Spanish Influenza seemed just like an ordinary cold when a person first got it. It developed quickly and sometimes people died just a few hours after they realised that they had the illness.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at medicine during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Why was Spanish Influenza known as \"The greatest enemy of all\"?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
