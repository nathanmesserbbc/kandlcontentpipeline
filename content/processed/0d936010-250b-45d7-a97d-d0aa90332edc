Bread is necessary but bread alone is never enough to satisfy the human spirit.\n Then, if Jesus will only worship the Devil he can have authority over all the nations on earth.\n Exercises and Readings\n* Take 10 minutes to close your eyes, relax and imagine being in the wilderness, the dry heat by day and cold by night. Describe what it feels like to be alone and hungry?\n * What does it feel like to be \"tempted\"?\n * Are you able to describe a situation where your faith or values have been put to the test?\n * Can you imagine what would test your faith today\n * Why do you think Jesus put at the heart of the prayer he taught his disciples: Lead us not into temptation?\n Power is an insidious temptation where evil can often masquerade as good. \n \"The end justifies the means\" is the mantra of many dictators. \n Then Jesus is taken to the pinnacle of the Temple. If he is the Son of God surely he will come to no harm if he throws himself down? Everyone would have to believe him. \n But Jesus refused to use any kind of power to compel belief. If he is truly the Son of God then the only power that ultimately means anything is the power of sacrificial love.\n Temptation and testing did not end there.\n The Devil left him \"until an opportune time\" and that time for Jesus would be in the Garden of Gethsemane on the night before his crucifixion.\n On our pilgrim journey open our minds to your truth, our ears to your Word and our hearts to your love.\n Strengthen us to meet whatever comes with courage, patience and joy in Jesus Christ our Saviour. \n* Inside Lent: Introduction\n * Lent: Inside temptation (9th March)\n * Lent: Inside doubt (16th March)\n * Lent: Inside anger (23rd March)\n * Lent: Inside love (30th March)\n * Lent: Inside fear (6th April)\n * Lent: Inside hope (13th April)\n * Easter Day - Inside joy (20th April)\nFind out more about your nearest BBC local radio station and BBC Radio 4 Sunday Worship.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"BBC Radio 4's Sunday Worship and Local Radio make six journeys Inside Lent.","datetime":"- 9 March 2014"}
