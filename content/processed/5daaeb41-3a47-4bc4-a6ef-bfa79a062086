They can discover how, despite the U-boats, Britain managed to keep everyone fed.\n Pupils will have the chance to work with primary source materials to conduct their own research.\n Useful links\n* BBC World War One At Home - Home Front Life\n * In pictures: How War Changed the Face of the Nation\n * British Library: Teaching resources - Daily life on the Home Front\n German attacks on vessels bringing food to Britain were an attempt to lower public morale. The people of Britain responded by producing more home-grown food. \n Pupils could find out more about the foods that could be produced by British farms. Where could particular crops be grown and at what time of year?\n The children could explore how seasonally-grown foods can be preserved without refrigeration for use at other times of the year. They could try some examples such as jams and pickles. \n The class could also find out about the methods of preservation traditionally used to stop fish and meat from decaying. How many of these methods are still in regular use today? You could ask the children to note down any examples when they next visit a supermarket. They could look out for products that are dried, tinned, smoked, pickled, salted or preserved in syrup.\n If time and facilities allow pupils could try making pickles or cooking a dish that uses dried ingredients such as beans or lentils.\n* In pictures: The Women's Land Army\n * In pictures: Women on the home front\n Useful links\n* Hands on History: High Street History\n * BBC History: Explore the history of your high street\n * Manchester Archives: Ministry of Food leaflet, 1918\n * IWM: Rationing and Food Shortages during the First World War\n Shortages were common during the war and the blockade meant less was arriving from overseas. As certain items became scarce, shopkeepers had to find other things to sell and they had to encourage people to buy them.\n With inspiration from old street photos, pupils could draw or model a row of typical high street shops and name the businesses. Assuming the role of shopkeepers, they could research what their shops might have sold before the war and design posters or advertising boards for their goods. \n Pupils could then find out how many of these items became scarce during the war. Were any of these foods rationed? Challenge the children to think about what they could sell instead to help them stay in business and keep people from going hungry.\n Tailors had to measure carefully whenever they made a garment. They measured in feet and inches and the rule was 'measure twice, cut once'.\n Wartime fashion\n* What clothes did people wear during WW1?\n Ask pupils to look closely at a waistcoat. An essential garment in the early 1900s, it has changed little since its Edwardian heyday. For instance, waistcoats typically still retain pockets for a watch and chain, although few of today's businessmen wear one. Ask the children to sketch the waistcoat and to measure every aspect of it in inches. They could use a tape measure marked in inches or a length of string, ribbon or tape marked in the same way.\n Pupils could go on to design their own waistcoats, first as drawings and then as patterns marked out on paper (strong brown parcel paper is a good choice). Encourage the children to discuss the various lengths and widths needed. Pupils should measure one another to make sure their waistcoats will fit. They could cut out their paper pieces and join them with tape. Can they manage to put on and wear their paper waistcoats? The children could decorate their creations and perhaps vote for the best 'tailor'.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Teaching ideas and lesson inspirations for teachers of primary KS2 students learning about World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
