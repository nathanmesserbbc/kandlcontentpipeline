Many fathers didn't come back from the war. Estimates vary, but between 300,000 and 500,000 British children had to cope with the death of their father in the war years. \n Some children were so young when their fathers went off to be soldiers, that they could hardly remember them. Many mothers faced bringing up their children on their own, with little or no help and only a small pension.\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes to accompany the 'How was the day structured?' section","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"A look back at family life during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
