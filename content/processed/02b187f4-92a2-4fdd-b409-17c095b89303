There were lots of new jobs to help with the war effort such as working in munitions factories (where weapons were made). \n Some women got the chance to work for the first time in jobs that were usually only for men. \n As soon as the war started, Parliament passed the Defence of the Realm Act, shortened to DORA. This gave the government more power than it would usually have. It allowed the government to quickly decide that something new could become a crime. For example, feeding wild animals became a crime because it was seen as a waste of food, which was hard to get during wartime. DORA also stopped newspapers from writing about anything that didn't support the war effort and which may have upset people who were fighting and working hard for their country. The government brought in Daylight Saving Time, where the clocks go forward one hour, so that daylight lasted longer and people could do more work.\n* Restrictions on keeping pigeons\n * Restrictions on public houses (pubs) so workers didn't get drunk\n * No lighting of bonfires or fireworks\n * A ban on buying binoculars\n * A charge for treason if anyone was caught discussing anything that might be useful to the enemy \n * The death penalty for breaking any of these laws\n * The death penalty for spies caught in Britain - German spies were shot in the Tower of London\nThe government also started using something called propaganda. They published lots of posters and articles to encourage people to help with the war effort and to make them believe that Britain was good and the enemy was bad. Lots of posters and cartoons made jokes about the Germans.\n Propaganda was also about making sure that people in Britain only knew what the government wanted them to know. For example, the government felt that it would not be helpful if people found out exactly how many soldiers had died because this might make them reduce their support for the war. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at causes of the war and the war years.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The effect of World War One back home in Britain.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
