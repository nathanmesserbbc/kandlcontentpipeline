We are only the latest in a long line of people, both Jews and Christians, who have read these stories for illumination about the way God deals with humanity, and now deals with us. In doing so, we say 'this is our story'.\"\n Find out more about your nearest BBC local radio station and BBC Radio 4 Sunday Worship.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Radio 4's Sunday Worship and Local Radio make 6 Lent â€˜Journeys of Faith'","datetime":"2015-02-17 08:00:00 +0000"}
