The fighting affected every soldier, even those lucky enough not to be wounded, and in May 1915, Walter was sent home to recover from illness. \n By 1916 he was back in France and in even worse battles, including the Battle of the Somme, a river in France where fierce fighting took place.\n Walter showed courage and coolness as a soldier, just as he had as a footballer. Other soldiers respected him. At Christmas time in 1916 Walter was sent back to Britain to be trained as an officer (someone who leads soldiers).\n At that time Army rules were that only a white, British-born person could be an officer in the Army. In Walter's case, however, the rules were ignored. \n In May 1917 Walter Tull was 'commissioned' as an officer, with the rank of lieutenant. \n Walter was sent to Italy and was soon in more fierce fighting. He was praised by his leader, the 'commanding officer', for leading soldiers across a river during a battle. He was recommended for a bravery medal, but never received it. \n Walter Tull was the first black officer to lead white British soldiers in battle.\n In the spring of 1918, Walter returned to France. The German army was making a last effort to win the war. Britain, France and the United States had big armies on the Western Front, the area in western Europe that saw the worst fighting. The German army attacked. \n On 25 March 1918, Walter led an attack on German trenches. They had to cross 'No Man's Land', which was open ground under fire from German machine-guns. Walter was hit and killed. \n His men tried to rescue his body, but were driven back by advancing Germans. Walter's body was never found. \n Related stories\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at the life and death of Walter Tull.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What the war was like for Walter","datetime":"On 25 March 1918"}
