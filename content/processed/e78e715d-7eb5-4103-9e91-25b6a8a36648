If you can get hold of pens and ink, ask children to try writing (in cursive/joined up writing) with them. Provide blotting paper if you can. \n Give children something to copy, perhaps chalked on a blackboard. Can pupils copy the lesson without blots, smudges or mistakes? Point out that slips and errors might have led to a rap on the knuckles with the ruler in the early 1900s!\n Ask the pupils to memorise a short passage. Start with a short list, say capital cities (London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Paris, Berlin, Washington). Chant the lesson together. Then challenge individuals to stand with hands behind their backs and recite from memory.\n The children could think about how useful they thought the lesson was. Did it have any weaknesses? Would it have been good for soldiers? How does it differ from modern ways of teaching?\n Dumbbells\n Rounders bats can make a good alternative to dumbbells.\n Alternatively the children could try the exercises with two large plastic bottles filled with sand. Each bottle should weigh roughly 1kg (approximately 2lb).\n Pupils could try exercising with dumbbells ('Indian clubs'). The children could look online for a simple exercise routine to try.\n Pupils could think about why schools at this time used dumbbells (they were cheap PE equipment and exercises did not require much space: most could be done in a standing position). \n To run a typical session of stretches as a warm-up or warm-down, use the teacher's commands from 'The Syllabus of Physical Exercises for Public Elementary Schools' (1909), as follows:\n* 'Class fall in. Eyes right, lines straight.' (Children form ranks)\n * 'Attention.' (Children stand like soldiers)\n * 'Stand easy.' (Children stand with feet apart, hands behind backs)\n * 'Hips firm.' (Children stand with feet together, hands on hips)\n* 'Hands on chest. Breathe in. Breathe out.' \n * 'Head to the left. Turn.' \n * 'Left leg sideways. Raise.' \n * 'Left knee raise. Hop.' \n * 'Arms downward. Stretch' \n * 'Arms upward. Stretch.'\nAdditional elements of 'drill' such as marching or skipping on the spot could be added.\n Children could try measuring (their height, things in the class) in feet and inches and convert their results into metric measures. Find out how many inches make a foot, how many feet make a yard and how many yards make a mile. \n Can they do World War One maths, such as 'How many feet in two miles?' \n The class could make a wall chart to show other imperial measures: ounces and pounds, or pints, quarts and gallons. Dictionaries and other sources have comparative charts of weights and measures. Children can check their results using online conversion calculators.\n Useful links\n* The Beamish Museum has a searchable collection of images\n * The BFI YouTube channel has a selection of 'Edwardian Britain' clips\n Pupils can search books and online photograph archives for images of school life in the early 1900s and during World War One.\n You could ask: 'Can you find any clues in your photographs that tell us what school life was like?' What is the school building like? How does the classroom compare with yours? How many children are there in the class? \n Children might make a model 1914 classroom, using a shoebox for a base. Encourage the children to add typical features, items of furniture and equipment. Some suggestions: high windows; benches with integral desks; blackboard and easel; high teacher's desk and stool; stove; writing slates; Indian clubs; dunce's cap; cane or tawse.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Teachers' notes and classroom suggestions looking at the school day and education during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
