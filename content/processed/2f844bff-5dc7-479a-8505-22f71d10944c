At the outbreak of war, he had to be aged between 19 and 38 and taller than 5 feet 3 inches. However, there were many younger and older soldiers who lied about their age. \n Once he was in the army, a soldier was given a rank. Most soldiers were privates to begin with. Some also moved up the ranks to become corporals, sergeants and officers. The higher the rank, the more a soldier was seen as a leader. \n Ranks defined a soldier's or officer's role and how much responsibility he had. They could be distinguished by the stripes and badges worn on the cuff of a soldier's or officer's coat. \n Each soldier had to carry a lot of equipment whilst out on the front line. These included: \n* Gas mask. This protected him against gas attacks from the enemy. \n * Weapons and ammunition. These included a rifle, bullets, a bayonet and some grenades. \n * Protective clothes. Items which were suitable for the trenches like boots, a ground sheet cape, puttees (long strips of cloth worn from the ankle to the knee) and a helmet. However, this was not always enough for the very damp conditions the soldiers lived in. \n * 'Webbing equipment' (kit made from strong, cotton webbing material). This included a haversack containing personal items such as knife, fork, shaving kit, water bottle, soap and towel. \n * Shovel. This helped him keep the trench the way it needed to be. He could use it to remove excessive mud.\nSoldiers suffered from many illnesses and injuries on the front line. Trenches were often cold and wet which made living in them very uncomfortable. Soldiers had to live with the constant fear of getting injured in battle and falling ill from the dirty and unhygienic conditions. Body lice were pests that made soldiers so itchy that they had to shave off their hair completely. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at life on the front line.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Who were the soldiers fighting in the war and what was their experience of the front line like?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
