Why was the poppy chosen as the symbol of remembrance? Watch this clip to find out. \n Introduce the topic of World War One using BBC Schools resources. You could put the war in its historical context by making a timeline, showing the two world wars and events that happened before and after them. Take the line right up to the present day. Explain that World War One began 100 years ago. When we reach such an important anniversary, it is a time to look back and try to make sense of what happened.\n Establish that the 1914 - 1918 conflict was called The Great War because the hostilities were global. The war was more destructive than any previous conflict in history. \n Explain that the main combatant nations were: Germany, Austria-Hungary and Turkey, who fought against Britain, the British Empire (India, Australia, Canada and others), France, Russia and (from 1917) the United States. BBC Schools resources will help explain the background.\n In 1933, peace campaigners started wearing white poppies for peace. White poppies came about after the British Legion started selling red poppies for Armistice Day. Peace campaigners in the No More War movement objected to the words 'Haig Fund' on the red poppies. (Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, commander of the British armies on the Western Front and officially a national hero, had become a hate-figure for some.) Women in the Co-operative movement took up the idea of the white poppy, as did the Peace Pledge Union, set up in 1934. Many of these campaigners argued that it was not their intention to devalue the wearing of the red poppy.\n \"\n Many in the churches never seem to question the annual remembrance cult. Personally I would love to organise an 'alternative remembrance service' ...\"\n Today, some people wear the red poppy. Some people wear the white poppy. Some people wear both the red and white poppy together. And many people do not wear a poppy at all. What do the students make of these differing attitudes? \n In recent times, the words 'Haig Fund' have been replaced on red poppies. The message on the black button at the centre of the flower now simply says 'Poppy Appeal'. Students could investigate this revision. When did it happen? Why did it happen? What do students make of the change? Is it an attempt to rewrite history?\n Ask students for their personal views on poppy wearing. Are they for? Against? Indifferent? \n Ask students to consider why so many soldiers were killed in World War One and why this had such an impact on people. War reporting was still confined to press photos and jerky silent newsreels in cinemas. There were no satellite TV reports. What makes all those World War One war images still shocking today?\n Useful link\n Students might respond to the above discussion points in a variety of ways. They might note that the war introduced new weapons, vastly more destructive than the mass formations of soldiers common in earlier wars. Generals were slow to devise effective strategies to cope with this new technology. Instead, infantry troops were often used as 'cannon fodder'. Images of World War One weaponry such as tanks, heavy artillery, machine guns, aircraft, Zeppelin airships, battleships, submarines and gas masks will reinforce the learning. Trench warfare on the Western Front was particularly gruesome, owing to the static nature of the fighting, which produced huge casualties with little gain in territory.\n Students could consider images or video clips of war graves from 1914 - 1918 and from other conflicts, including the D-Day war cemeteries in Normandy and those of the Korean and Vietnam wars. They might also look at memorials to those who fought in the Falklands, Northern Ireland, Afghanistan and Iraq.\n Useful link\n Discuss the students' reactions. How do such images affect modern attitudes to remembrance?\n They could consider too, footage of British military cemeteries and monuments, such as the Menin Gate, or the Fields of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey, in Cardiff or Belfast.\n Students might also study pictures of war graves or pictures of some of the disabled ex-servicemen associated with modern wars, such as the conflict in Afghanistan. They could look too at images of the modern army engaged in non-combat roles such as working on relief projects.\n Students could also consider the following questions: Why do people (including school and college parties) still visit war graves on what was once the Western Front? What do young people today feel when they visit these cemeteries? What should they feel?\n Useful links\n Students might locate and study some of the many images of World War One. They could look in particular for photographs of the Western Front (trenches, troops, casualties, devastation); for images of convalescent homes or military hospitals in Britain and for images of the home front (women at work, Land Army and schoolchildren waving flags).\n You might ask students for their response to a 'Help for Heroes' poster. How does the experience of the wounded in current conflicts differ from those of the World War One? What are the shared experiences? \n Students might like to hear about and research the personal stories of some of those caught up in World War One. They could look for information about:\n* Capt Noel Chavasse (twice a VC winner, an army doctor and former athlete, killed in 1917)\n * Edith Cavell (a nurse shot for helping soldiers)\n * Elsie Inglis (a doctor and women's rights campaigner, died in 1917)\n * Harry Patch (one of the last survivors of the 1914 to 1918 war, died in 2009)\n * Jack Cornwell ( a boy-sailor killed at the Battle of Jutland)\n * Lord Kitchener (a trained soldier responsible for army strategy during the war, died 1916)\n * Walter Tull (a black army officer, a former footballer who served in the Footballers Battalion, killed in 1918)\n * Wilfred Owen (a poet who died fighting in the war in 1918 aged 25)\nStudents may have old family photos at home that they might like to share or even wartime memorabilia. If these items are too precious to bring to school, the students could photograph them instead. \n The students could make a display of all their 'found objects' and try to discover more about them from books and websites. \n Useful link\n Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. \n We will remember them.'\n These lines are from a poem by Laurence Binyon, published in September 1914, only a month after World War One had begun. Ask students what they think the verse means. They might like to find and read the rest of the poem.\n At the time he wrote these lines, Binyon was a civilian. Does that make a difference to how the students now see the lines? Binyon was too old to enlist as a soldier, but volunteered in 1916 to serve on the Western Front as a Red Cross orderly. How do the students think Binyon himself came to think of this verse?\n Useful BBC links\n Introduce other war poetry including the work of Rupert Brooke, Wilfred Owen, Isaac Rosenberg, Siegfried Sassoon, Edward Thomas and others. They could link this work to their study of poetry in English and to their course work.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"World War One Secondary Assembly - Remembrance - Teachers' Notes","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
