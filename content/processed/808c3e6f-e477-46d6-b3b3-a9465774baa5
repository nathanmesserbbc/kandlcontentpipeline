Most were women, though when VAD started in 1914 men could join as well. They were all volunteers, so they did not get paid. \n Thousands of women became VAD nurses, and some went to France, helping in hospitals close to the battlefields. VAD nurses cared for wounded and sick soldiers in Army hospitals and 'rest stations', where exhausted soldiers had a few days to recover, and in convalescent homes, where they could stay until they were as well as possible. \n War nurses\n* Aged 16, Marjorie Grigsby said she was 20 years old so that she could become a war nurse in 1916.\n * Flora Sandes went to Serbia in 1914 as a nurse, but became a soldier in the Serbian Army.\n * Around 200 nurses from British military nursing services were killed or died during the war. \nVAD nurses wore uniforms which included a blue dress and a white pinafore. The rules were strict: no make-up, no long nails, always look smart, always carry scissors, safety pins and a pencil! VAD nurses said they were 'willing to do anything' so would often wash and clean as well as nurse their patients. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at women's roles on the front line during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out about the work of Voluntary Aid Detachment Nurses during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
