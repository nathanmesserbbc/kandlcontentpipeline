Encourage the students to study them. Ask them what clues they could look for to determine when each photo was taken. Can they place the images in chronological order? \n Useful links\n* IWM: 15 photos of London in World War One\n * Watch: Bitesize - Industry in Scotland during World War One\n Consider obtaining images from local museums so that students can see what their area used to look like.\n What can pupils tell about the people or places shown in the photographs? Are there any clues about the circumstances in which they lived? If you have background information on any of the photographs, share this with students. Were any of the images misleading?\n The birth of spin\n* Neil Oliver on wartime propaganda techniques\n Propaganda was widely used to motivate the public to support the war. Pupils could discuss the reasons people might have had for joining the forces in World War One. \n You could show students some examples of recruitment posters. Encourage them to talk about who these might have been aimed at and why they worked. You could also ask students to consider why conscientious objectors were not persuaded by these.\n Pupils could design their own recruitment poster. They could select a target audience and think about ways to encourage their potential recruits to enlist. \n The class could go on to look at some of today's advertisements, discussing the different messages they convey and the people each advertisement aims to influence. \n Students could compare posters from the gallery to modern advertisements and say which they think are more effective and why. \n* In pictures: Recruitment posters of WW1\n * IWM: 11 Amazing WW1 Recruitment posters\n Teenage tommies\n* Greg James investigates how Britain let 250,000 underage soldiers fight in WW1\n The class could be provided with verses from the following two very different wartime poems about recruitment. Both are available online.\n 'Fall In' by Harold Begbie captures the peer pressure that was put on young men to enlist. The poem lends itself to choral performance by groups of children. You could ask each group to take a different verse and find a way to act out its message. The wartime poster on which this poem appeared is available to view in Oxford University's digital archive of First World War poetry.\n 'Recruiting' by E.A. Mackintosh describes a man's appalled reaction to seeing a recruiting poster and to the women of the 'white feather movement' who tried to shame men into joining up. He condemns: 'Girls with feathers, vulgar songs, washy verse on England's need.' You could choose verses from the poem for groups to perform as a contrast to Begbie.\n* British Pathé: WW1 Recruitment And Conscription\n * The First World War Poetry Digital Archive\n* In pictures: The Women's Land Army\n * In pictures: Women on the home front\n The class could watch short newsreel clips of British people at work on the land during the war years. Suitable online clips are widely available on video-sharing sites. The British Pathé website has an extensive collection of clips about life on the home front.\n Useful clips\n* Watch: Green Farm, Cardiff: A Land Girl in the City\n * Watch: Recruitment and the role of women in WW1\n * Watch: Women on the Home Front, 1914-1918\n * Watch: Horrible Histories: Suffragettes Song\n You could ask groups of children to choose a clip. They could improvise dialogue for the people who appear in the newsreels and then develop their improvisations into written scripts. \n As the children develop their scenes, prompt them to think about how their characters might feel about working on the land or moving away from their families in the town to live on a farm (as many members of the Women's Land Army had to do).\n Pupils could perform their scripts for other members of the class, or perhaps at a school assembly.\n Useful links\n* What did WW1 really do for women?\n * IWM: The Women's Land Army in pictures\n * IWM: Women's War Work during WW1\n Older girls went to work on Britain's farms to replace the labourers who had gone to fight. Boy Scouts who were old enough to leave home but not to join the forces were also encouraged to move to the countryside to help.\n Pupils could discuss how they would feel about moving away from their family to live somewhere very different. They could then write a letter home describing their new way of life in the country and how they have adjusted. \n Letter writing could be made even more realistic by using nib pens, ink and blotting paper.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Teaching ideas and lesson inspirations for teachers of primary KS2 students learning about World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
