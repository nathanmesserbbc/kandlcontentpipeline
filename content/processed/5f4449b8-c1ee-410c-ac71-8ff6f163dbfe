His meticulous style led his friend, and fellow composer, Igor Stravinsky to describe him as 'the most perfect of Swiss clockmakers', while others drew a line from France's impressionist painters to Ravel and his contemporaries, whose music echoed the powerful creativity of that movement.\n But in August 1914, the great powers of Europe descended into war, and by the end of the month, German troops were crossing the French border. The stage was set for four years of fighting on French soil - four years in which eight million French men were mobilised.\n Among them was Ravel. He was 39 years old; only just eligible to fight. But this famous and successful composer wanted to join the war effort, and would play a part in some of France's most bloody battles.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"Why did Ravel, a famous musician, join the fight for France in World War One?
