Many of the horses that pulled the carts and wagons had been taken off to work at the Front. \n There were few cars and vans. Motor vehicles were still a new thing and petrol to run them was very expensive. But by the time the war ended, cars, vans and lorries were here to stay. The days of horses on our streets were coming to an end.\n In the war years, people walked, or got about by bicycle, ringing bells to alert pedestrians. Another sound heard in the streets was the school bell which would be rung just before nine o'clock in the morning to call children to class. The bell was often hung in a small bell tower on the roof of the school, some can still be seen today in older schools. \n At home, pans clanging on the kitchen range were familiar sounds, as were the noises of people chopping firewood to burn in the range or to put in the copper to heat water. The clatter of coal shooting into a coal cellar was another everyday sound and the smell of smoke from the fireplace was constant. Most people heated their homes with wood or coal fires. Back in 1914, all the chimneys that are still on old houses would have had smoke coming out of them and the soot made all the surrounding buildings grimy and black.\n Glossary\n Fires were kept to a minimum to avoid soot on Mondays. Monday was 'wash day' when everyone's dirty laundry was cleaned, though better off people might send their dirty clothes and sheets to the laundry to be washed and ironed. \n Before there were washing machines, this was a big job that had to be done by hand. It was hard, heavy work. Water bubbled as it boiled in the copper and splashed as it was poured into the wash tub. Shortly afterwards came the trundling wheels of the mangle, as it squeezed water out of the washing.\n Everybody knew the smell of carbolic soap. The same bar of soap was used to wash people, clothes and even the kitchen floor. Some people say it smelled 'like hospitals'. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes to accompany the 'How was the day structured?' section","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out what daily life was like for children growing up during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
