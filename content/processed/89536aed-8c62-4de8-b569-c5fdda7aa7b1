Are you a super-taster? Test your tastebuds to find out...\n Super-tasters experience the five basic tastes, especially bitter foods, with greater intensity. Work out if you are a super-taster by following Mark's simple step-by-step instructions.\n* Bottle of blue food dye\n * Cotton buds\n * Tweezers\n * Hole punch reinforcers\n * Magnifying glass\n * Taster chart (see below)\n * Damp cloth or tissues\n How does taste work?\n When we eat food it comes into contact with our taste buds, which are bundled inside the small bumps on the tongue and soft palate called papillae. \n Chemicals in the food, known as tastants, make contact with the 30-100 taster receptor cells inside each taste bud. These stimulate nearby sensory neurons, which send a signal to an area at the back of the brain. This process creates five main taste sensations - sweet, salty, sour, bitter and umami (savoury).\n However, to experience flavour we combine taste with our other senses - especially smell and touch.\n Be very careful with the food dye as it stains and check that you're not sensitive to its ingredients!\n Place a cotton bud into your bottle of blue food dye until it is well coated. Stick your tongue out and, using a mirror for guidance, coat the front third of your tongue with the dye.\n Next, carefully place a hole punch reinforcer on to your tongue. You can stick two ring reinforcers together to help transfer it more smoothly. If you don't have any reinforcers you can use a hole-punch to create a hole in a small square of waxed paper.\n The blue dye will stain the tongue but slide off the prominent pink bumps known as papillae. Each bump contains three to five taste buds.\n Ask a friend to count how many pink bumps they can see on your tongue inside the ring reinforcer - try to keep your tongue still! They may find it easier using a magnifying glass. \n Alternatively you can try and count them in the mirror or take a photo of your tongue and zoom in on the image. \n The chart below reveals how your sense of taste compares to the rest of the nation...","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Mark Miodownik shows you in his step-by-step guide how to examine your tongue for extra tastebuds","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
