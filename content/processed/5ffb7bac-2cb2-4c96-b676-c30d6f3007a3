It makes my day when I receive a letter from them and hear about how life back at home is for them. It cheers me up, helps me to forget where I am for a minute. Apparently my little Jimmy has got really rather big while I've been out here fighting. He keeps asking when I'm going to come home. I wish I knew. \n And there's my diary. I never kept one before the war, I thought it was for girls. But now it seems kind of important. I need to write down what happens out here so people can find out what it's like. Otherwise they'll never understand. They might not even believe me. But I have to write it down.\n We fill them up and they look after us. I know that sounds funny but it's true. \n We don't always use sand, sometimes it is just dirt and earth. If the Germans or the Austrians fire at us and the bullet or shell blast hits a sandbag, that normally stops it from getting to us. At least, it lessens the impact. It isn't so good for artillery fire though. That normally finds its way through so we've still got to be on our guard.\n Even when we aren't fighting, we always have something or other to do. We've got a lot of daily duties, you see. \n Some of us have to take out the smelly latrine waste. Some of us have to fill up sandbags which help stop the impact of the explosions. Then there are all the things we need to do to stop the enemy, like putting up barbed wire and fixing it when it gets broken. The same with the communication cables. When the weather is bad, the trench floor can get flooded and the walls can collapse. Later tonight, my job is to go out and fix a communication wire that the Germans have broken. We need it so that we can get in touch with other units on the front line.\n We carry half our life in our haversacks. Together with our full webbing kit and our weapons, it can be such a heavy load to carry. \n I can carry the full kit no trouble, but then we have to walk miles with it sometimes and even fight with it on! That's a real pain. Our haversacks hold our personal items such as our knife, fork, shaving kit, soap and towel. We can't do without these things so we have to keep them close to us.\n It's our poor old feet that the enemy is really killing. These trenches aren't nice places to stand but sometimes that's all we can do, especially if we are under attack. \n Our boots can get filled with water - and sometimes there are stinky leaks from the latrine, which makes them really muddy and soggy. Our boots keep some of it out but when it's bad, it goes right through them and our socks. It makes our feet freezing cold and wet.\n My friend had it really bad last month. He had been standing in a soaking trench for so long that his socks started to sort of grow on to his foot. It became infected and horrid. He's at the clearing station now. It's a bit like a hospital. They might have to send him away to a proper hospital though. Someone even said he might lose his leg. \n Those pesky rats! We can't get rid of them no matter how hard we try. \n I shot five of them the other day myself. No sooner were they gone then ten more came running around. They seem to love these trenches as much as I hate them. Rotten vermin! I was sitting there grabbing a few minutes rest last night, when I felt this big, furry thing brushing against my face. I thought it was a cat because that's how big it was. But I opened my eyes to find this disgusting, gigantic rat dancing all over me. I almost screamed. \n The periscope is a great help to us when watching out for the enemy. \n It means that we don't need to stick our heads out and risk being hit to see what is happening. Instead, we can just look through the viewfinder and it shows us everything that is going on over the top (outside). We can see what's coming and get ready for it. It really helps us to feel more safe. \n Our weapons keep us safe too. We've got our rifles and they've got bayonets stuck on the ends of them which is like a blade. \n Some of us don't like guns and bayonets because they can hurt people. But out here we need them. Sometimes it is either us or them. What I mean is that we need to shoot the enemy first or they will shoot us. Our rifles can fire fifteen rounds in about a minute. We also have grenades which we can throw by hand to cause an explosion. The bayonet is pretty good for scraping mud off our boots and for opening tin cans. But keep quiet about that, they don't know that's what we use them for! \n We stay in our trenches. It's safest that way. \n Sometimes we have to wait and watch for ages until we see the enemy. As every moment passes, we get more and more tired and more and more nervous. At any minute, we could get the call to shoot or go over the top. We just don't know when it is going to come.\n We've got a set quota of food here, in the trenches. It isn't very much. \n We get a bit of a mixture but only a tiny amount. It's never piping hot. We're supposed to get a few ounces of cheese and jam. I love jam. But half the time we don't because it's in short supply or they haven't been able to get it over to us this week. I really miss my jam on toast. Most of the time all we eat is food from cans, especially bully beef. It's alright. Nothing like jam though. To be honest, I can't really taste the bully beef anymore. I've had it so much that it just tastes like nothing now. I wish they could get more jam to us.\n I used to get up at seven o'clock in the morning when I was at home; nine o'clock on Sundays. Those days are long gone. \n We can only sleep in the afternoon and hardly ever at night when we have to be alert. We have to be ready in the dark because the enemy likes to attack then. We don't get very much sleep at all really. Even when we do get a few hours, it's disturbed by those nasty rats and a sudden announcement that an attack is on its way. I've got really big bags under my eyes. Sometimes I'm so tired that I can't even think straight. It sure makes it hard going out on the battlefield. \n I've got a dog called Chutney. She's my best friend out here, she really is. She is just so clever. \n Last week she smelt some gas whilst we were asleep. Clever girl started running around and barking to wake us up. She even waited until we had all put on our gas masks before she ran away to protect herself. She's just great to have around as well, for the company. She even stayed with old Patrick when he was dying on the field. She tried to help him but there was no hope for Patrick. I don't know what I'd do without my Chutney.\n We don't get much time to ourselves. In fact, I can't remember the last time I had a night off. But when we do, cards are good. I do like playing cards. \n Me and the boys play blackjack, rummy and poker. I always win of course, apart from when Johnny cheats. Which is a lot. Yes, that's fun. I wish we got to play some cards more often.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at life on the front line.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What was it like for soldiers living in the trenches during World War One?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
