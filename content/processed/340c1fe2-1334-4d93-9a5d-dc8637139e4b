But the stocks of those have declined a lot so they're now only a small part of what we do here.\"\n The oysters most commonly bought and eaten are actually Pacific oysters, the species Crassostrea gigas, also known as rock oysters.\n First introduced into UK waters in 1926, this oyster spawns when water temperatures reach 18C. That means the oyster spat is available all year round and can be farmed in hatcheries.\n Native oysters are only available September to April, outside of the spawning season which occurs when waters are warmer.\n A report by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says Pacific oysters are cultivated far more than natives, as natives don't grow as fast, don't have a high survival rate and seed can be more expensive.\n \"Rock oysters are a much more hardy animalâ€¦ the natives needs a lot of tender, loving care if you like,\" explains Richard Haward.\n \"Most restaurants these days only have rock oysters,\" says Mr Haward.\n But he thinks the native, although more expensive, is worth trying to save.\n Technical challenge\n \"Yes it will cost you more money, but it is thought to be better. Some people say it's a got a more delicate taste. It's certainly got a much firmer texture. And it's certainly much more difficult to grow, you get much higher mortality and all that sort of thing, so for all those reasons, it is a more expensive product.\"\n So could the UK's native oyster stocks be revived? \n In order to instigate such a revival, demand needs to increase.\n But oysters can be an acquired taste that divides opinion.\n \"If I ask a hundred people do you like oysters, half will say yes and half will say no. But when half of them say no, when you ask the next question, have you ever tried them, half of those haven't even tried them,\" says Mr Haward.\n Experts agree it's a fight to convince many people to eat oysters at all.\n Katy Davidson, runs Mangez Moi and considers herself an oyster champion - she organises masterclasses in learning to shuck them, as well as festivals to encourage more people to eat them.\n She is currently hosting the Great British Oyster Festival, to try and get people hooked on the shellfish.\n Perception of price is the biggest barrier she says, as oysters are often thought of as an expensive luxury food. But you can buy them for as little as 50p each. \n People are also reluctant to try the shellfish in different ways. \"People believe you have to down it in one - I say 'no, you're missing out,'\" she explains. \"When you chew, you get a whole set of flavours.\"\n And flavours can really vary (see table below) depending on where the oysters come from - as they filter six litres of water a day to feed on the oxygen and nutrients they need to live and grow, they take on the salinity of the water.\n They are also \"unbelievably nutritious\", says Katy Davidson. \"They contain magnesium, zinc, copper, and have high levels of dopamine,\" she says. In addition, one oyster is about 33 calories, and has a high level of Vitamin B12, Vitamin D and Iron.\n So if they are so healthy, why are people still put off?\n \"The texture. They can be soft and slimy. And some people say 'oh it's just the taste of seawater',\" says Richard Haward.\n \"But we do get our converts.\"\n However, converting to oysters is one thing, and feasting on native oysters is another.\n If demand for them grows, it may place too much pressure on protected stocks, hampering their recovery. \n Having a taste for native oysters, it seems, may not be the indulgence it once was. \n Taste the difference\n The flavour of oysters can be different according to where they come from and the environmental conditions there. When tasting, it is advisable to chew your oyster and aerate it to influence the flavours on your palate.\n Explore the Shellfish Association of Great Britain's complete list.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The UK's native oyster population has taken a battering - is it time to turn our backs on one of Britain's finest home grown foods?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
