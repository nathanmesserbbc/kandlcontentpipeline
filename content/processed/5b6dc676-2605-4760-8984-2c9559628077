In the past, people just moved on to new words.\"\n Examples are the words \"queer\" for the gay community and the so-called N-word for black communities, she says.\n 'Interesting phenomenon'\n However, Dr Nelson adds that there's something different about \"Yid\".\n \"This is an example of a derogatory word that's been reclaimed but not by community itself, but by football supporters who are linked to this population. It's a really interesting phenomenon,\" she says.\n \"It means that a lot of the people in the stand chanting this word have never been called this word to their faces.\"\n Dr Nelson points out that this is sort of the reverse of what happened in historical periods of anti-Semitism, when people distanced themselves from the Jewish community.\n \"Now you have swathes of London identifying themselves with the Jewish community and the Y-word,\" she says.\n Alternatively, Dr Beer thinks the re-appropriation of offensive words only works in theory and that it would be very difficult to differentiate between those using the word maliciously and those who wear it with pride.\n \"Anybody with some kind of historical memory, any Jewish person with any relative that experienced the Holocaust would not easily walk around anywhere shouting 'Yid',\" she says. \n Reclaiming words\n The word \"slut\" made headlines in 2011 when women joined \"slut walks\" all over the world. They were marching in response to a Toronto police officer, who said that women should not dress like \"sluts\" if they wanted to avoid being raped.\n \"If anyone is intent on reclaiming anything, reclaim in a different way, find something else that doesn't have any type of difficult history attached to it. \n \"Delve into your culture, find a completely neutral word and start bandying that about. Let that be your reclamation,\" adds Dr Beer.\n But users of language are very good at establishing context and intentions behind utterances, says Dr Nelson.\n \"It's part of our special ability as humans. We're very good at mind-reading and we usually know what is meant when words are used in context, especially if they're being shouted at a football match,\" she says.\n So, was the FA right to threaten to press charges against fans? Dr Nelson does not think so.\n \"This is one of the features of language which is basically impossible to control,\" she says.\n \"You can ban or even legislate against the use of particular words, but people will always find a way to use language to insult each other. \n \"It's very difficult to control and legislate language. At the same time, if there's no intention to cause offense to a particular group in society then it's important to be aware of which words are considered offensive or derogatory by members of that group.\" \n Dr Beer agrees that prosecuting fans would be going to another extreme.\n \"It's very good to draw attention to all of these issues, but it'd be even better if the debate could be substantiated with a bit more cultural and historical context, and I'm not persuaded that draconian measures are going to clarify anything,\" she says. \n However, she also specifies that if the use of the Y-word is accompanied with \"really awful behaviour\" a warning to the fans in question would be useful. Dr Beer thinks education is the best compromise.\n \"I think if anything is taken out of context, from any culture, then it's immediately open to misinterpretation, misunderstanding and distortion,\" she says.\n \"To appropriate something from somewhere else without that understanding is a little bit risky. But if we start banning words, where is that taking us and what do we ban next?\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The FA has recently warned that fans using the Y-word could face prosecution.
