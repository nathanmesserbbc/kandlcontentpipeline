Other soldiers and support staff suffered from less obvious symptoms of trauma, which manifested in more subtle ways.\n Artists who served during the war were influenced by the trauma they suffered. This can be seen in their works â€“ from poems detailing their experiences to autobiographies where the process of writing helped them cope with their trauma.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"Baroness Shirley Williams examines how shell shock and the trauma of WW1 influenced writers such as her mother, Vera Brittain, author of Testament of Youth.","datetime":"1914-11-12 12:00:00 +0000"}
