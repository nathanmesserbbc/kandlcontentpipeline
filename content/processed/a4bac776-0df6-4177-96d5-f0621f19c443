He drew in the audiences with his strong opinions and unscripted lectures.\n Although the initial broadcasts included cut-aways to the studio audience, these were found to be distracting attention away from the entertaining Taylor. Soon the camera focused purely on the historian alone. Yet this technique is considered to be outdated now.\n* How did Andrew Marr explore the 'History of the World'?\n * Watch an AJP Taylor lecture on Churchill\n * Watch Philippa Gregory talk about resurrecting history for The White Queen\n \"It was a stripped-down format which very few people dare to do now. It is very risky as television is such a visual medium. The audience expects a lot more,\" Sian Nicholas from Aberystwyth's Centre for Media History says.\n These expectations were first met in 1964 with the BBC's The Great War series which focused on the events of the First World War.\n \"It was a huge undertaking and an attempt to create history for the public. A huge number of historians were involved and it used footage of the time. It was like nothing which had been seen before,\" Nicholas says.\n Erin Bell, co-author of History on Television, agrees: \"The Great War used revolutionary techniques. It allowed us to listen to the voices of those affected - and it didn't just focus on the British soldiers. We were able to hear the experiences of the French, the Germans.\n \"The Great War and later the ITV series The World at War (1973-1974), also showed the growth of the rise of the oral history movement\", she adds.\n At the time there were groups working in Oxford who set out to encourage new ways of thinking about the past and how it affected the present. The activities carried out by the 'History Workshops' sought to gain an understanding of the past from those who lived through it - even if their recollections contradicted the dominant narratives.\n \t\"\n We didn't expect the success it did have but it was a good lesson in following the courage of your convictions\"\n Although oral histories are a standard component for programme-makers now, there still remains the challenge about how to tackle narratives and historical stories which took place way before film and photography existed. Technological advances nowadays have made life a lot easier, but these are still only recent developments. \n \"A History of Britain again helped changed the broadcast landscape when it was aired in 2000,\" says Bell.\n \"It was a large series with high production values and led by a well-known figure - Simon Schama - and it showed a real desire to mark a significant point in history,\" she adds.\n Mike Ibeji, who was involved with the development and production of the series, says it was an amazing bit of programming to be involved in.\n \"I am an ex-historian and I was in my element. At the time we created it TV history was moribund. Yet we knew were working on something special . We didn't expect the success it did have but it was a good lesson in following the courage of your convictions.\"\n He said there were significant challenges: \"I remember sitting down with about five or six of the premier re-enactment groups - each with their specialist areas such as Romans, or the Saxon or Medieval period and working with them trying to figure out how to get people in fields to re-enact the Battle of Hastings, then parcel them out to various directors who were filming different bits of the show. \n \"It was something that just hadn't been done. I didn't ask myself 'can we do it', I asked 'how do we do it'.\n \"I think one of the legacies that we left was the ability for TV history to evolve into drama documentaries. There is also a lot more scope to do that now thanks to the technology available. Last year I worked on a programme called Dark Matters for the Discovery Channel and we shot all of it in a green room studio. The world is our oyster.\"\n But it's not just about what you see on screen, history programmes now are a lot more immersive. Ordinary people have taken part in the \"house format\" - a type of reality show instigated by Channel 4's 1900 house.\n \"This was a fabulous show which had people living the life of a late Victorian family. There was a certain artificiality but it gave people a chance to see what life was like for ordinary people on a day-to-day basis. I think it helped make it relevant to modern audience,\" Sian Nicholas says.\n And historical dramas have also attracted large audiences. I, Claudius, focusing on the history of Rome was a 1976 BBC adaptation of Robert Graves's I, Claudius and Claudius the God. It was so popular that in 2000 it placed 12th on the British Film Institute's list of 100 Greatest British Television Programmes.\n The ITV costume drama Downton Abbey has achieved worldwide success, while the BBC's latest production - The White Queen - has seen it become a trending topic on social media every time it is aired.\n But, while historical dramas can draw people in, Nicholas warns: \"There is a danger though of the audience thinking that this is it - this is the history when this is just a version of history.\"\n Yet Dominic Crossley-Holland, head of BBC history and business production, says the audience is at the heart of everything the corporation produces and it is \"embracing digital platforms\" in a bid to enhance the audience experience, while drama, cartoons and other interactive experiences were on the agenda when it came to telling history stories.\n \"We have to work hard to make the subject connect with the audience. We try to inform and educate and connect. Whether we are on TV or radio or online, we have to work hard. \n He says the BBC could not work alone, adding that partnerships were \"absolutely vital\" for the corporation to be able to make world class programming. \n \"We have a range of partners, for example we teamed up with the British Museum for the Radio 4 series A History of the World in 100 Objects last year while we are working closely with the Imperial War Museum on our First World War centenary coverage in 2014.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How has history been depicted on television over the years?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
