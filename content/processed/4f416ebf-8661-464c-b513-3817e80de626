Here she answers your questions on space physics - from dark energygravitational waves and super massive black holes\n Nobody knows. They could be formed by the collapse of a massive star, which sucks in all surrounding material and grows and grows. Or they could be formed by the collapse of a \"super massive star\" or dense stellar cluster. Both ideas are currently being tested by astrophysicists; no-one knows the answer yet.\n Actually, our everyday lives are carried out in three spatial dimensions (length, breadth, height), and one of time. You can pinpoint anything that happens if you know its spatial coordinate and what time it occurred. More exotic theories of the universe suggest that there might be extra spatial dimensions, but if there are, we are blissfully unaware of them.\n The strongest gravitational waves are produced by the movements of the most massive objects. You should still have gravitational waves produced by, for example, the movement of the Earth round the Sun, but the energies involved are tiny. As experiments like LIGO haven't yet seen direct evidence of gravitational waves produced by massive bodies like black holes, it's not surprising that they haven't detected the much weaker signals from lighter, closer objects.\n Light travels independently of space-time stretching - so the idea is that a gravity wave will change the distance a laser beam has to travel when the wave ripples across an experiment. This will change the light patterns observed in the experiment. So far, though, there's been no sign of any gravitational waves using this approach.\n You know how the pitch (or frequency) of a police siren speeding away from you seems to sound lower? We call this the \"Doppler effect\". Redshift is the Doppler effect for light - we see light from galaxies moving away from us shifted down in frequency, which makes the light move to the red end of the spectrum. Galaxies moving towards us have their light shifted to higher frequencies, to the blue end. That's how we can tell which direction they are moving in.\n A good question! We don't know. It's unseen (hence the \"dark\"), and it's thought to fill the universe, and be responsible for making the universe's expansion speed up (hence the \"energy\"). However, we don't yet know what it is, what causes it, and how to explain it. It's one of the big mysteries of physics.\n There are no laws placing limits on the speed at which space-time (and the universe) expands. However, you're not allowed to let information (or light) travel faster than the speed of light. This is mind-bending, but it does mean that it's perfectly possible for the universe to expand faster than the speed of light, as long as you don't see it happening. \n You have the answer in the equation: speed of light = frequency x wavelength. Redshift decreases the frequency of light. When this happens, the wavelength of the light increases at the same time. This keeps frequency multiplied by wavelength constant and equal to the speed of light.\n This situation can't happen in special relativity. Nothing goes faster than the speed of light. If you are sitting on a photon looking at a photon travelling away from you, it would seem to be travelling at the speed of light, no faster.\n This is a type of energy field, present throughout the universe, which is thought to give fundamental particles their mass. It's invisible, but we can tell if it's there by finding the Higgs boson which is the particle that accompanies it. \n The experiment at LHC has told us that many of the simplest versions of supersymmetry, that we were hoping to see, don't exist - but there are plenty of other possible versions remaining. In other words supersymmetry might still describe dark matter, even if we're in the dark as to whether supersymmetry is correct or not. We need to keep looking for proof one way or the other, when the LHC raises its energy in a couple of years\n How the Hubble Telescope 'sees' dark matter\n These properties depend on the exact details of how the protons, neutrons and electrons link up to form the atoms and molecules of the material. For example, the colour of a material depends on the spectrum of light it emits. This depends in turn on the distinct energies electrons can have in the material, because light is emitted when electrons move to lower energy levels. Studying these properties is where physics meets chemistry.\n Beta radiation doesn't happen in isolation - only inside atoms, and atoms only decay when this lets them reach a lower energy state. You have to take the energy of the whole system, not just the neutron, proton and electron, into account. When you do this, you'll find that there's enough energy available to make this decay work.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Dr Tara Shears spends her life recreating the moments after the Big Bang at CERN.
