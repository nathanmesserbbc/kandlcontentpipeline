The Royal Navy had hundreds of ships and more than 200,000 sailors.\n The Navy played an important role during World War One. It protected the British Isles and its colonies and was also used to blockade the ports of enemy countries to try and stop supplies of food and other materials getting in.\n The Royal Navy Air Service started in 1914 and the first specially-built aircraft carrier HMS Argus was launched in 1918.\n There were many different jobs for sailors on board: Gunner; Signal Man; Stoker (they supplied the ships' engines with coal); Armourer (who looked after guns and shells); Steward (a servant to officers and the Captain); Cook; and Bugler (a musician who would signal messages or warnings to other sailors by playing a special tune on his bugle). \n* HMS Centurion, above, took part in the Battle of Jutland in World War One and she also took part in World War Two. \n * Battleships were the largest warships of World War One with very big guns.\n * Warships were ships with guns for fighting sea battles.\n * A Destroyer was a small fast warship which fired guns and torpedoes.\n * A Cruiser Naval ship was a bit smaller than a battleship. It was able to cruise the oceans and protect trade.\n Able Seamen had at least two years' experience at sea and were skilled in routine deck duties. Men with less than two years' experience were called Landsmen or Ordinary Seamen. There would also be Engineers on board who would look after the ship engines and a Captain to command the ship and tell everyone what to do.\n The Royal Navy was very popular and many boys and young men wanted to join. They hoped to go to sea on one of the navy's 42 battleships. These were the largest warships and were manned by more than 1,000 sailors. There were also hundreds of smaller ships too such as cruisers, destroyers and submarines. Young boys would often work as a Deck Hand helping the more experienced sailors.\n The Royal Navy protected Britain's coasts, the British Empire and British trade all over the world. World War One only saw one really big sea battle, the Battle of Jutland in 1916.\n Submarines were very different from any other kind of warship and had a very small crew compared to the big warships. Submarines were a lot cheaper to build than ships and could destroy really big and powerful enemy warships. They were able to sail into places ordinary ships could not get to and were very good at stopping enemy ships from getting too close to the coast of Britain. \n Although British submarines formed a very small part of the Royal Navy, Britain had the world's largest submarine service and they were among the first vessels put to sea when war broke out in 1914.\n Living and working space inside a submarine was very small. Sometimes the men would be living under the sea for months at a time and space had to be made to store lots of food and military supplies which made living and working conditions even more cramped. \n As the crews were small on board submarines, each man was given a special role but they would also work other jobs as needed to make sure the submarine always worked well. The submarine would have to be looked after for 24 hours a day so the men would work in shifts (in turns). \n There were electricians and engineers working in the engineering room to make the submarine move and a Captain to oversee and guide the crew. A man would always keep watch for danger from enemy submarines or ships and there would be a specialist chart reader to help navigate the submarine in the dark waters of the deep sea.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the front line during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The story of roles in the Navy","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
