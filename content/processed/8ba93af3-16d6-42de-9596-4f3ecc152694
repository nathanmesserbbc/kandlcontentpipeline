From among their number they elect the Dean of the College who presides over its meetings and the election of a new Pope\n * Cardinal Priests: are the senior Archbishops of the world, with each having a title of an ancient Diocese of Rome\n * Cardinal Deacons: hold the lowest rank of the Cardinals. They are members of the Roman Curia and theologians who have been honoured by the Pope for their contribution to the Church\n Cardinals are instantly recognisable as they wear distinctive red robes.\n This custom has been running for centuries, with the colour of blood symbolising the commitment to defend the church to the death.\n Dignity and respect is bestowed on cardinals as they are referred to by the title of \"Your Eminence\".\n The College of Cardinals is broken up into three ranks: Cardinal Bishops, Cardinal Priests and Cardinal Deacons.\n Generally, the Cardinal Bishops and Deacons are members of the Roman Curia, with the Cardinal Priests being the senior Archbishops of the world.\n British cardinals have played important roles in the past, with Cardinal Murphy O'Connor serving in four different Vatican offices, including the Congregation for Bishops which involves direct input in appointing bishops across the world.\n Cardinal Basil Hume, who was Archbishop of Westminster between 1976-1999, was widely recognised as using his role in persuading Pope John Paul II to visit Britain in 1982.\n He also presided over the conversion of about 300 Anglican priests who converted to Catholicism when the Church of England voted to ordain women priests in 1992.\n As the new cardinals begin to get to grips with their new role and visit Rome on a much more regular basis, is their role likely to change?\n \"I think the role of the cardinal will develop and they will have much more of a say in the governance of the Church, and therefore become more influential,\" explains Austen Ivereigh, director of Catholic Voices.\n \"At the last conclave, it was decided that the College of Cardinals would become an advisory body to the Pope, hence more trips to Rome and more meetings with the Pope.\n \"Traditionally, we've disregarded the over 80s who don't get a vote in a conclave. But they'll also have an important role to play as they will also attend the meetings.\"\n Why cardinals wear red\n* Cardinals wear red robes, along with scarlet zucchetto (skullcap) and biretta (four cornered hat with tassel) \n * Red signifies the colour of blood and symbolises their commitment to defend the church\n * During daily business, a cardinal's robes are edged with red to signify his dignity and respect\n * On official occasions, the cardinal's robes are entirely red\n Soon after his appointment, Pope Francis appointed a group of eight cardinals to look at reforming the Curia, which has been blamed for the Church's hesitant response to sex abuse and other crises.\n Recent scandals to have hit the Church have included clerical sexual abuse, financial problems at the Vatican bank and the theft of documents from Pope Benedict XVI's desk.\n Catholic writer and historian Michael Walsh thinks the Church should find a more democratic way to operate the institution.\n \"I like cardinals and their history, but I feel like they are out of place in the modern world.\n \"Also, the Pope chooses all the cardinals and this has a bearing on choosing the next pontiff as the cardinals do the voting. So the Pope can manipulate the outcome of the vote by bringing in people who have the same values as him, so there has to be a much more democratic way of operating the church.\"\n Although Walsh concedes it would be impossible to change the constitution, he recognises the global status of the Pope and his representatives and what this brings to the Church.\n \"The Pope is an international figure and the cardinals he chooses represent him around the world, so it is important to recognise the important role that they play.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"As the Pope prepares to appoint 19 new cardinals, including Archbishop Vincent Nichols, BBC Religion and Ethics examines the role of cardinals.","datetime":"2014-02-22 12:00:00 +0000"}
