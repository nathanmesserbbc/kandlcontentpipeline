Set in the fictional fishing village of Llareggub ('bugger-all' spelt backwards), it is populated by an outrageous cast of drunkards, prostitutes, unrequited lovers, bigamists and ghosts.\n It is, however, more than a bizarre soap opera. Behind the bawdy humour are fine examples of Thomas's unique literary style. He famously gave only one direction to the cast before the play's opening night, \"Love the words, love the words\", emphasising his own obsession with the sound of words above all else.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"BBC iWonder explores the literary techniques and devices used by Dylan Thomas in his famous play for voices, Under Milk Wood.","datetime":"1970-01-01 12:00:00 +0100"}
