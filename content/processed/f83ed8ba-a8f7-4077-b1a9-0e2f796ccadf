Many had lost their boots \n But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind; \n Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.\n Gas! Gas! Quick, boys! - An ecstasy of fumbling, \n And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime...\n As under a green sea, I saw him drowning. \n He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. \n Pro patria mori.\n Carry on.\n Carry on.\n Carry on.\n Carry on.\n Are like the bloody butchers' benches,\n Carry on.\n Carry on.\n Not a rotten 'also ran,'\n Carry on.\n A little drop of peace wouldn't do me any harm.\n Hanging On The Old Barbed Wire, Soldiers' Song\n I know where he is (x 3).\n He's drunk up on the dugout floor.\n I seen him, drunk up on the dugout floor.\n He's pinning a medal on his chest. \n He's hanging on the old barbed wire.\n Held us in servitude.\n To all whom we must send to seek and die for peace.\n With him, that we may save our fortitude alive.\n Theirs be the hard, but ours the lonely bed.\n Nought were we spared - of us, this word shall not be said.\n Where are the girls of Arsenal? Munition workers' song\n Where are the girls of Arsenal?\n For precious little pay.\n Where would the Empire be?\n Who thinks of June's first rose today?\n ­ ­ ­  ­ ­ ­ ­ ­  rough bright hair will reach it down.\n As are the fearless stars from these veiled lamps of town.\n From too much looking on the face of grief, the face of dread?\n Of the small eager hand, the shining eyes, the rough bright head?","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Poems and songs featured in the guide: Does poetry distort our view of World War One?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
