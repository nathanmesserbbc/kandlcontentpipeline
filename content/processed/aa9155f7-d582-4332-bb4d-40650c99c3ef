Everyone at home avoided wearing new clothes, as it was seen to be wasteful and unpatriotic.\n When back on the home front, people wore their uniforms to show their active role in the war. Men who weren't in uniform were a target for groups of women who would put white feathers into their buttonholes. This was supposed to mark the men out as cowards and shame them into joining the army. Some British people refused to fight, often because of their religious views. They were known as 'conscientious objectors'.\n Wartime uniforms were based on everyday clothes, but adapted to make it easy to move, work and fight. Short jackets were less awkward to move in than frock coats. Shirts with high collars that stopped you turning your head were useless for a soldier, so turn-down collars took their place. Pocket watches were replaced by watches that could be strapped to the wrist. Women's uniforms got rid of long skirts that were hard to run about in. In the Women's Land Army, they even wore trousers!\n After the war was over, these changes became part of the new fashions of the 1920s. The days of high collars, frock coats and long dresses were over.\n Nurses, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and members of the Women's Land Army all wore their uniforms proudly, to show they were helping to win the war. \n Today, Scouts often wear sweatshirts, but their basic uniform of khaki shirt and neck scarf is much the same as it was in the early 1900s. Perhaps the shorts are a bit less baggy! Guides first wore scout-like hats and shirts, teamed with long blue skirts. Over time, their uniform developed into an all-blue outfit. Scouts and guides both use a 'woggle' to hold their scarves in place. This handy little scarf-ring only came along in the 1920s.\n Teachers' notes to accompany the 'What clothes did people wear?' section","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out how World War One changed clothing and fashion","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
