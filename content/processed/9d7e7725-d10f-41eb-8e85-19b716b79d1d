The Turner Prize is attracting people there. It's not going to get the same numbers as London but it's certainly attracting visitors from all over Ireland and further afield.\"\n Lynette Yiadom-Boakye's installation 'Extracts and Verses' is part of the show at Ebrington Barracks\n Since its inception in 1984 the Turner Prize has generated its fair share of controversy and comment. \n Supporters maintain that The Turner Prize provokes debate about British contemporary art amongst a broad audience, but many have been critical of the award. Art critic David Lee once claimed that The Turner Prize had \"institutionalised conceptual art to the exclusion of all other denominations of work.\"\n Suggestions that The Turner Prize is reserved for the artistic elite appear to have been largely dispelled by the numbers who have poured in through the doors to view the exhibition in Derry since 23 October.\n Within 11 days of the opening, The Turner Prize exhibition had attracted 13,500 visitors. During the first week alone an average of 194 people visited the every hour. \n While the Turner Prize has attracted attendances of over 600,000 when exhibited in London, the crowds flocking to this year's exhibition are still extremely healthy given that Derry has a population of just over 108,000. \n \t\"\n There's certainly an element of curiosity among the people but everyone has really taken it to heart too\"\nChris McCann confirms that the ordinary people of the city and its surrounding area are taking an interest in contemporary visual art.\n \"There's certainly an element of curiosity among the people of Derry but everyone has really taken it to heart too,\" says McCann, who works for The Culture Company - the organisation responsible for staging events during the City of Culture celebrations. \n \"The range of people you can see in here is really diverse. There's a perception that you might only see arty types at the Turner prize and while they are coming, the general public are mixing alongside them. It really is the case that you have everyone from school kids to grannies and granddads coming to the Turner Prize exhibition. \" \n While the Turner Prize is proving popular, is it helping to change how people view the city? \n \"The perception change around the city has been massive,\" adds McCann. \"Perhaps the only previous press concerning Derry had been around the Troubles or Bloody Sunday but the coverage in the media now for The Turner Prize and the City of Culture in general has changed all of that.\" \n The Turner Prize may be helping to alter perceptions of Derry but one of the challenges the city now faces is its ability to sustain an artistic legacy, enabling it to potentially become an artistic hub in Northern Ireland.\n \t\"\n The belief has to be there that the arts can contribute to the long-term value to this city. \"\n Willie Doherty, whose exhibition UNSEEN is currently on show at the City Factory Gallery in Londonderry, believes that any legacy that the Turner Prize might potentially offer could be lost by those who have the financial clout to ensure its survival.\n \"I think this 'Year of Culture' has been amazingly successful in galvanising that sense of transformation that people occasionally get a glimpse of,\" says Doherty.\n \"But I think if they don't do something to build and develop the visual arts beyond January [2014] then the whole year could be an example of tokenism.\n \"We've been presented with a great opportunity this year but it's not going to happen on its own - it has to be worked at, fought for and paid for. The belief has to be there that the arts can contribute long-term value to this city. \n \"We don't have industry here in Derry. The model of culture in terms of attracting business and tourism is often discussed by politicians - now we have an opportunity to grasp that. Fundamentally though, I don't think they believe in it so they're not prepared to finance it.\"\n A lot of discussion about the legacy that Londonderry could derive from The Turner Prize centres on the exhibition site at the Ebrington Barracks. \n Ilex Urban Regeneration Company was established by the Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland and the Department for Social Development in Northern Ireland. The organisation has spent Â£2.4m on re-developing a gallery space at the historic barracks, where soldiers of James II bombarded the walled city during the siege of Derry. \n Now, it is the future plans for that gallery space that are coming under attack. Three board members on the Culture Company have resigned with one prominent member, Ana Leddy citing a lack of vision on the issue of legacy as her chief reason for quitting the post.\n Ilex has stated that when the Turner Prize exhibition closes in January the space will be used as a Creative Industries Hub. That will include space for design related industries, expressive industries and media and information industries. Willie Doherty believes that altering the gallery space would be a counter-productive move.\n \"Having made that capital investment in the building to then not continue to use it - that's kind of insane,\" he says. \"It's not as if Derry has a shortage of office space. To put offices into a building on a landmark site like that - it's not realising its potential and it's merely paying lip-service to the idea of culture.\"\n So while the Turner Prize may be helping to overcome the perception of just who modern visual art is for, the legacy it could bring to Derry is still something, like the outcome of the Turner Prize itself, that remains a topic for debate. \n For more reaction to the Turner Prize watch The Arts Show on BBC Two Northern Ireland at 23:25GMT on Thursday 21 November. It is available afterwards on BBC iPlayer.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How taking the Turner Prize to Londonderry has challenged views of the award being for an art-loving elite, and tackled perceptions of the city itself","datetime":"2013-12-02 12:00:00 +0000"}
