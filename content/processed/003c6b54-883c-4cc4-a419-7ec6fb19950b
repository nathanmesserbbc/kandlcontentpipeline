At Clapton's Old Spotted Dog ground, Walter Tull attracted attention with his exceptional performances. People said he should be a professional. Professional footballers were paid Â£4 a week - quite a lot then, but nothing like what star players get paid today. \n Tottenham Hotspur ('Spurs'), one of London's top teams, asked Walter to join them. At 21, Walter was now only the second black professional player ever in the Football League. \n He went with his new team on a tour to South America. The Tottenham players were surprised that South Americans didn't speak English!\n Walter did well in his first season at Tottenham. He was praised for his cool play and accurate passing. However, in 1910, he lost his place in the first team and at the beginning of the 1911 season he was transferred to Northampton Town. \n Walter played 110 games for the Northampton Town team, known as 'The Cobblers' - because the town was famous for shoe-making.\n World War One began in 1914. At the time, the famous Scottish club Glasgow Rangers were trying to sign Walter. As soon as war was declared, Walter joined the Army. \n He joined what became known as the Footballers' Battalion, which was part of the Middlesex Regiment. A battalion was a main fighting unit, with around 1,000 men. \n Lots of other players did the same. Professional league football was suspended until 1919, after the war ended. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at the life and death of Walter Tull.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The story of Walter's rising football career","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
