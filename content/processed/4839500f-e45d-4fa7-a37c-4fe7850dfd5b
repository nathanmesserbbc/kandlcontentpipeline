In episode one, two schoolboys tweeted a picture following the suicide of a 15 year old girl. Craven episode one is still available to watch. \n In part two Detective Inspector Terry Bird visits the school that Florence Henderson went to before she took her own life. He explains to the class how cruel online comments can mount up making the victim feel that the world is against them.\n Cyberbullying is when someone uses digital technology - such as emails, text messages, social networking sites, chat rooms and online forums - to deliberately upset, harass, humiliate, intimidate or threaten someone else. \n It may take the form of malicious texts or emails, or it may involve posting abusive messages or embarrassing photos or videos online. Cyberbullying can also involve setting up a 'hate' site or taking over someone's online profile and leaving offensive comments and images. \n What may have started out as 'a bit of a laugh', can end up turning into something a lot more serious. And if the bully makes frequent contact with the person being bullied, it can feel like a relentless campaign of abuse and can be extremely distressing. \n Cyberbullying is much more likely to affect young people. But, as with other types of bullying, it can happen to adults too. Teachers, for example, can be easy targets. \n I'm being bullied online, what can I do? \n* Gather and document as much evidence as you can.\n * Seek help and support from relevant organisations, for example the Bullying UK helpline on 0808 800 2222, or via their email support service on the Family Lives website.\n * If you are being bullied online (or offline) by someone at work, report the problem to your HR department or line manager, or if at school or college report it to your teacher or tutor.\n * Most social networking sites have a means of reporting such issues, for example Facebook, click here. Twitter has also introduced an in-Tweet 'Report Abuse' button across all app platforms and its website.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"DI Bird visits Florence's school to talk about the damage caused by online bullying.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
