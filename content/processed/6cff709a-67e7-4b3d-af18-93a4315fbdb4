When the UK began testing \"the bomb\" it led to the birth of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).\n CND asserted that nuclear weapon tests could accidentally launch the world into war. They believed then, as now, in unilateral disarmament. \n Nuclear weapons\n* Nuclear bombs have only been used twice in history, both by the US on Japan\n * The first, on 6 August 1945, killed more than 100,000 people in the city of Hiroshima\n * Three days later, the second killed at least 74,000 people in Nagasaki\n * Britain began testing nuclear weapons in the 1950s and exploded its first hydrogen bomb in 1957\n * The hydrogen bomb is believed to be up to 1,000 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima\n Annual four-day marches were held from 1958 until 1963, between Aldermaston (where nuclear weapons were made) and London - a 52-mile stretch. \n One protester who was involved every time was peace activist Pat Arrowsmith, who still campaigns today. The 83-year-old has been arrested more times than she can count, and has been in prison 11 times. \n There was a sense of hope and optimism in the air, with lots of singing, says Arrowsmith. \"Everyone was very determined. There was a real fear the bomb would get used.\"\n While the first five were peaceful affairs, the last march in 1963 did not go entirely as planned. A day before it, top secret government intelligence was leaked to the press, politicians and demonstrators. \n The opening words of pamphlets released to all and titled \"DANGER! OFFICIAL SECRET\" said: \"This document is about a small group of people who have accepted thermonuclear war as a probability and are consciously and carefully planning for it.\" \n It revealed the location of a secret underground bunker, one of a network of 14 regional \"secret headquarters\" from which the country would be run in the event of nuclear war.\n The documents were sent out by a group calling themselves Spies for Peace, but exactly who was involved, or who leaked the information, still largely remains a mystery. \n The one man named was peace activist and anarchist Nicolas Walter - and he was only identified after his death, by his daughter.\n Natasha Walter, an author and human rights activist, remembers hearing anecdotes about how the \"spies\" first found the government bunker - and how they went to extraordinary lengths to keep their identities a secret. They wore gloves so the pamphlets wouldn't have their finger prints on them, and threw their typewriter into a river.\n \"There was a lovely cloak-and-dagger feel about it. It was only when I was older that I realised the risk they had run of very long prison sentences,\" she adds. \n Such was the tension between the US and Soviet Union that it was common knowledge among the political classes that the government was making plans in the event of a nuclear attack. \n But the extent of their strategy would have been a shock to ordinary people, says Walter. \"The government had made elaborate plans to ensure only their own survival. People were being kept in the dark.\"\n Pat Arrowsmith remembers the breakaway group going to the bunkers and why the Spies for Peace felt it was so important to expose it.\n \"These bunkers were for VIPs. They were not just for you and me - the hoi-polloi. People were angry that they were reserved for only a special hierarchy of the population.\"\n Though, as The Times newspaper pointed out, such secrets were necessary to prevent information spreading to \"a potential enemy\".\n Analysis: The value of a nuclear deterrent\n Having nuclear weapons increases the dangers for everyone concerned. They are not successful at deterring anyone else as they increase the value attached for other countries to deploy these weapons, so they create a vicious circle. Dr Rebecca Johnson - founder of The Acronym Institute for Disarmament Diplomacy \n Nuclear weapons have from their inception been considered by successive governments to be vitally important for our national security and defence. If the UK had renounced its nuclear capability it has been argued that it could be open to nuclear blackmail. The Soviet Union had much larger conventional forces than the UK and NATO as a whole. As a responsible government the UK feels the need to maintain national security in situations where nuclear weapons act as a deterrent. They are for war prevention purposes not war fighting purposes. Dr Kristan Stoddart - International politics lecturer at Aberystwyth University\n The Times wrote that the pamphlet was likely to be sponsored by communist supporters of nuclear disarmament, and that: \"the authorities are perturbed about the motives of what they regard as a serious and irresponsible breach of the Official Secrets Act.\"\n The report continued: \"If any of the information reaches the intelligence services of a potential enemy... the Spies for Peace will have the satisfaction of knowing that at least one of the regional seats of government will be placed forthwith high on the target priorities of any country that might want to paralyse Britain with a nuclear strike.\" \n \"There was tension between the mainstream CND, who lobbied and campaigned in a respectable way, and the direct action wing, which had more of an anarchistic element,\" says CND's current general secretary Kate Hudson.\n As the marches reached London on 15 April 1963, fights and clashes with the police broke out.\n Pacifist magazine Peace News predicted this would be the last march, declaring: \"Whatever happens, the movement can never be the same again. This Aldermaston march was the most confused and divided ever. The worst sign of change within the movement was the increasing tendency to violence and mob politics.\"\n At the time, the founder of CND - Canon Collins - said anarchist groups had \"muscled in\" on the march. He said: \"It is stupid and thoroughly to be regrettedâ€¦ They have distracted attention from the real purpose of the demonstration and done great harm to the cause they claim to be standing for.\"\n Aldermaston memories\n We really thought there was an imminent danger by accidental design, and that nuclear war would ring out. Our case seemed so strong and we couldn't understand why we couldn't convince everybody.\n I remember the march being very tiring, so we sang We Will Overcome to keep our sprits up.\n There were some anti-CND demonstrators who believed we were all communists and that the march was a plot to make it easier for the Soviet Union to attack us.\n I don't think we failed. We aroused a national consciousness that nuclear war could occur by accident, and that there was a desperate need for a unilateral nuclear disarmament to set an example to the world. There still is.\n CND achieved some success when in 1963 the International Test Ban Treaty was signed which restricted nuclear weapon testing to underground. \n But the following year, Peace News' predictions came true. There was no march. \n There have been four-day marches since, but none has been on a similar scale.\n The popularity of any movement ebbs and flows but the anti-nuclear idealism which had led to these protest marches has not died down, says Hudson. Instead, the political context has changed and the same people focus their energy on different causes. \n When the US and Soviet Union reached an agreement and set up a telephone hot-line, ending the immediate threat of nuclear war, it calmed people's fears. \n Although the CND movement may have quietened, for Pat Arrowsmith, its cause will continue as long as the UK has \"the bomb\".\n \"We are playing a deadly game, as it's a game that's real. That's why it's so dangerous to say that this weapon is only a deterrent. You can't assume we will never use it. It's the kind of weapon that unless it's used first, isn't going to be effective.\"\n As for the Spies for Peace, they got away with it completely. Nobody in their lifetime was discovered or arrested.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Why was 1963 a pivotal moment for the UK's anti-nuclear movement?","datetime":"1963-04-15 12:00:00 +0100"}
