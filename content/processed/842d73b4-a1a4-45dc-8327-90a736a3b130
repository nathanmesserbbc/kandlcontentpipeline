Some failed the medical test and others were in 'reserved occupations'. \n This meant they did jobs that were vital to the war effort on the home front such as driving trains and buses, working in the coal mines, shipyards and munitions factories. Some men worked as farmers who were needed to grow food for the troops and civilians. Other men guarded the coast in case of an enemy invasion.\n Many clergymen also stayed at home to look after the pastoral needs of their parishes (communities) though some went to war as chaplains to look after the fighting men. Doctors were needed to tend the sick and wounded at home in Britain and at the front too. There were not many female doctors at this time so the male doctors were kept very busy in hospitals and in surgeries around Britain.\n Woman were trained to do many of the jobs that had been done by men before the war: factory work; acting as postmen and milk men; being porters at railway stations; and as teachers . At first it seemed strange to see women doing these 'men's jobs' but people soon got used to it.\n Some men refused to fight on moral or religious grounds and were called 'conscientious objectors'. They said their consciences (inner beliefs) would not allow them to kill. Some conscientious objectors would work in jobs on the home front to help in the war effort or on the front line in non-combatant (non-fighting) roles such as driving ambulances, being medical orderlies or serving in canteens. Some conscientious objectors refused to do anything that would help the war effort at all and were sent to prison. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Why some men stayed to work on the Home Front during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
