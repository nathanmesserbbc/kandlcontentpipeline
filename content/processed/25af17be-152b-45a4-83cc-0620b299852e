Soldiers on the actual front line got even less meat and vegetables than this. \n 'Maconchie's meat stew' and hard biscuits was a meal that many soldiers ate. Sadly, the meat was mostly fat. This, along with a shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables, was responsible for many soldiers to suffer from upset stomachs!","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What did soldiers eat on the front line?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
