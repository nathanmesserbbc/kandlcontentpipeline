Many kitchens had electric light, but there were no electric kettles, coffee makers, electric toasters, food mixers or microwaves.\n In the larder the family stored most of its food. Meat was kept in a metal box or 'meat safe', away from flies. The house had no refrigerator or freezer. In hot weather, milk kept cool in a bucket of water. On the shelves were tins, bottles, paper bags of flour and sugar, and other groceries such as jars of jam. \n Ironing\n* Ironing was hard work - a metal flat iron weighed 4lb (1.8 kg).\n * People cut up old blankets to make ironing board covers.\n For breakfast, most families had porridge, eggs and bacon, though cereals were catching on. Poor families made do with bread and dripping, which was the fat drained from cooked meat. Favourite dinners were stews, meat puddings and pies, ham, fish and chips, and Sunday roasts. People ate potatoes, cabbage, carrots and onions, but only had fresh peas and beans in the summer when they were in season.\n Women walked to local shops or the market to buy food. They shopped at the baker, grocer, greengrocer, fishmonger and butcher. The milkman called every day. Boys on bikes delivered orders, and some traders called house-to-house in a van or a horse and cart.\n People covered food plates and milk jugs with wire covers or muslin cloth to keep off flies. They swatted insects with fly-swatters, and hung up sticky flypapers to trap them. They used a jam jar covered with a paper cone, wide end at the top. A spot of jam inside attracted flies. A fly could walk in, but not out again. \n Washday was hard work. People washed clothes by hand, using bars of soap or soap flakes. Some families sent sheets and towels to the local laundry. For an extra-hot wash, people put washing in a coal-fired copper or boiler. To dry the washing, they squeezed the water out through the rollers of a contraption called a mangle then hung it on the washing line to dry. \n Related stories\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at a typical kitchen during the World War One period","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What a typical kitchen looked like during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
