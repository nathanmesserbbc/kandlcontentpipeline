The military effort he planned on the Western Front turned into a stalemate (where neither side was winning) and was taking too long.\n It also led to many British soldiers losing their lives. There was a shell shortage, which Kitchener was blamed for. He had arguments with lots of other members of the Cabinet. He felt they knew nothing about war because they had never fought in one. \n Eventually, he offered to resign but the Prime Minister did not accept this because he knew how popular Kitchener was in Britain. He carried on for a while and was made Knight of the Garter in May 1915. \n Kitchener eventually left his job as not all of his colleagues in command agreed with the decisions he had made. Some army commanders spoke directly to the cabinet instead of speaking through him. This made him feel they did not respect him. \n Kitchener was invited to Russia to give advice on the Russian army. He sailed on 5 June 1916. At around 19.40 that night, his ship hit a German mine and sank. \n Kitchener's body was never found but it was assumed he died in the explosion. He is remembered for his hard work, his commanding personality and his pointing finger on that famous poster. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas for Lord Kitchener.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What happened to Lord Kitchener after World War One ended?","datetime":"1916-06-05 12:00:00 +0100"}
