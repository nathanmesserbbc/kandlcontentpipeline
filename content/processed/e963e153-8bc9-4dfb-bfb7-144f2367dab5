Office tasks could take a long time for workers to complete as there were no modern day devices such as computers to help them. \n Some offices had typewriters which would help to speed up letter-writing but if you made a mistake you had to throw the letter away and start again. Some documents had to be handwritten into special log books, for example sales and purchases in a shop or factory. \n Documents would be stored in large drawers called 'filing cabinets'. Telephone calls were put through an exchange (a telephone operator who would transfer a call) and it could take a long time to make a call. \n The Civil Service is a huge government organisation that runs Britain and what was then the Empire. During the war the Civil Service employed thousands of people to help to run the country and manage all the work that was created by the war. The Civil Service was divided into several departments, each to help the government Minister in charge. The Home Office was in charge of people and businesses on the home front such as the police, crime and prisons while the Foreign Office looked after international relations, people living and working in the British Empire.\n When the war started, Lloyd George made a War Cabinet (group of senior ministers) which took responsibility for the war. The war cabinet contained experienced politicians who would make important decisions about the war or make new regulations and laws.\n Other roles in the government included clerks and advisors who would write letters or give people advice. Some men would work in towns across Britain and others in the British Empire advising citizens about things like travel, property, pensions and insurance. Local government employees also worked in Labour Exchanges (job centres) in towns and in the rural areas where there were huge numbers of people who needed to be given jobs to help the war effort.\n The British Empire, which included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, Africa, the West Indies (now called the Caribbean) and some colonies in the Pacific and South America, ruled over a quarter of the land and populations around the world. During the war it became very difficult for businesses to survive as it sometimes became impossible to transport goods around the Empire. This was because German naval blockades stopped ships supplying raw materials and goods from leaving or reaching Britain.\n There were no supermarkets so most shops were small family businesses though many larger towns would also have a department store. \n* Shopkeepers weighed goods on balance scales, using metal weights.\n * Grocers sold butter from a tub, 'patting' it into blocks with wooden paddles and then wrapping the block in paper.\n Food shops included greengrocers (vegetables and fruit), grocers (general stores), bakers, butchers, and fishmongers. \n Most high streets also had ironmongers (what we call today hardware shops selling tools and general household items), clothes shops, a sweetshop and a chemist. Most people paid in cash as there were no credit cards. \n By 1917 most shopkeepers were older people, because younger men were all in the armed forces. \n In the beginning of 1918 the government introduced food rationing to ensure fair shares for all and ensure that civilians had enough to eat. \n This meant people could buy less meat, sugar, butter and margarine and needed coupons as well as money to buy rationed goods.\n Few families had cars to carry shopping home. So when people went shopping they carried shopping bags and baskets.\n Most shopkeepers would deliver food and other purchases to their customers either by van or using delivery boys on bicycles with baskets. \n Children were often sent on errands to the shops, with a shopping list. Sometimes they ran back home with the shopping, hoping their mother would give them 'a penny for going'.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The roles of men in business  during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
