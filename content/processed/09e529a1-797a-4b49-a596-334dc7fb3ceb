She travelled abroad where she nursed wounded soldiers and cleaned hospitals. She also trained nurses. \n Nursing in the Crimea \n Before the Crimean War, although there had been doctors in military hospitals, the people who looked after the hospital were often patients who had recovered enough to help. These helpers often had no interest in the patients and were bad nurses and cooks. Florence changed all this dramatically.\n There was a shortage of trained medical staff during World War One. This meant that London Medical Colleges changed their admission policies to accept more women as medical students. In 1914, the London School of Medicine for Women had its largest intake ever recorded. \n The war meant many changes for the roles of female nurses and doctors. It became much more common for female nurses and doctors to treat male patients. Before the war they had mainly treated female patients. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at women's roles on the front line during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out about the roles women undertook in medicine during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
