It was very normal for a man to work in the same job for most of his working life.\n Many men worked in the coal mining, steel, shipbuilding and textiles industries. Every morning the factory or mine 'hooter' (a siren) would sound when it was time to go to work.\n Other men worked in the countryside and worked in jobs such as farmers, farm labourers, shepherds, blacksmiths, postmen and village shopkeepers. Around the coast many men were fishermen. Life was hard with long hours and low pay. People tended to live close to where they worked, often in a house provided by the railway company, coal mine owner or farmer. If they lost their job, they would lose their home too. Life expectancy was about 54 years for women and 50 for men.\n Richer men who had a better education, might own their own businesses, work in their family business or as a manager for a larger company or shop . Some were civil servants or in banking while others were doctors, lawyers or clergymen. There were also administrative (office) jobs in the British Empire. Before the war the British Empire ruled a quarter of the land on Earth and populations around the world. \n The upper classes were the smallest group in Britain. Many were rich as they had inherited (were given) money from their family or were landowners or owned mines or factories. Some might be Members of Parliament (MPs) or perhaps Ministers in the Government.\n Before the war, most married women stayed at home to look after the home and children while their husbands were the 'breadwinners' who worked and brought in a weekly wage to feed and clothe their families and provide a roof over their heads. \n When the war came, things changed dramatically with hundreds of thousands of men volunteering to go to fight while many women went out to work to help with the war effort and to help feed their families. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Introduction to some of the roles men had who worked on the home front during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
