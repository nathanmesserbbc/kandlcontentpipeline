It is now the Royal British Legion and makes Remembrance Day poppies every year to raise funds for ex-servicemen and women.\n Haig died in London of a heart attack on 29 January 1928. Thousands watched his funeral procession in London but he was buried in Scotland, at Dryburgh Abbey. A simple stone marks the grave of the general who led one of the biggest armies Britain had ever sent to war.\n After his death some people blamed Haig for the terrible loss of soldiers in the war. They thought he was a ruthless and uncaring general and some even called him 'the butcher of the Somme'.\n Haig believed if he stuck to his plan, he would win. Those who blame Haig say he was stubborn, continuing with attacks when they were clearly failing. He is blamed for being old-fashioned in his approach to war, for not making proper use of new tanks and aircraft. In the end his army did win but at a terrible cost.\n People who write about history often have very different views and this is especially true of World War One. People who knew Haig had different views of him. The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George was very critical of him. The USA general John J Pershing admired him. Since World War One ended, people have argued about why the war took the course that it did and about Haig's part in the deaths of so many men.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at 'Douglas Haig' during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How Haig is remembered today.","datetime":"1928-01-29 12:00:00 +0000"}
