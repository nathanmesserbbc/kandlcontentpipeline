Who were the posters aimed at? Why are particular images and symbols used? Which poster does the class think is the most effective? (They could take a vote.)\n Challenge pupils to create their own posters in the same style. They could choose to illustrate one of these wartime messages:\n* 'Every man from 18 to 61 should enrol today'\n * 'Hands wanted for National Service. If you cannot fight for your country, work for it.'\n * 'Women are working night and day to win the war'\n * 'Don't buy new clothes needlessly'\nAn old-fashioned tin bath was around 530 mm long, 380 mm wide and 210 mm deep. Can the children use these measurements to work out how much water the bath could hold? You could get them to convert their answer from metric to imperial measures. \n The children might go on to fill a bucket with water and find out how much it holds. How many buckets of water would it take to fill a tin bath? \n Video clip\n* Library of Scotland: Lochgelly at Work and Play clip\n The film clip 'Lochgelly at Work and Play' gives a vivid picture of the living conditions of working families in the first quarter of the 20th century. (The clip is from around 1922, but gives a good idea of 'wash day'.) \n Pupils might try hand-washing a muddy shirt in a pail of hot water, using a bar of carbolic soap. They could use a broom handle to pound the shirt inside the pail. How easy is it to get the shirt clean? How would pupils describe the smell of the soap? (The distinctive smell of carbolic is often mentioned by those who had to use it.) You could explain that the same bar of soap was used to wash clothes, people and even the kitchen floor.\n Pupils could wring the shirt out by hand and hang it on a line to dry. They could go on to find out more about washday in the early 1900s. Can they discover how a 'washboard', a 'mangle', a 'posser' and a 'dolly' or 'dolly peg' were used? They could use reference books, or look online for information.\n Pupils could mime typical jobs in the war years: queuing for food, chopping wood, carrying water, mending and darning, adding coal to a kitchen range, knitting socks for soldiers, feeding chickens, digging the vegetable patch. \n You might also try playing a game of 'Mother Says' (same rules as 'Simon Says') with the class.\n The high street\n The children could gather a selection of photographs of British streets from the early 1900s and the war years. They could find images in books, in local or online archives. \n Challenge pupils to provide 'sound effects' to complement the photographs. A photo of a school playground might be accompanied by the sound of a school bell, for example. A busy market might have the sounds of stall holders shouting and the trundling wheels of handcarts. What other human/animal/mechanical noises might they make up? (Horses, cars, steam trains, trams, street musicians...)","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Teachers' notes and classroom suggestions to accompany the 'How was the day structured' resources","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
