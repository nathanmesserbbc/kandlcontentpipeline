When that child is likely be \"another future monarch\", that attention often intensifies. Therefore, he adds, it is necessary for royals to have plans and procedures in place about how to inform the world of the birth.\n The Foreign Office has, in the past, been responsible for notifying the UK's overseas territories, while Buckingham Palace has directly contacted all the Commonwealth realms with news of a royal birth.\n For the Queen's own birth, the circumstances were slightly different as it was not obvious she would one day succeed to the throne. She was third-in-line after her uncle, the future King Edward VIII and her father, George VI who became king following his brother's abdication in 1936. \n Yet this did not stop a crowd from lining up outside her home in 17 Bruton Street in order to see the latest royal descendant.\n A month later, the interest was still so intense that the child at times had to be taken out of the back door for her morning airing.\n \"It doesn't matter which royal is having a baby, there is always significant interest - this is the UK's first family after all,\" royal expert Victoria Arbiter explains.\n By the time Prince Charles - a direct heir - was born in 1948, the media landscape had changed significantly and the news was immediately broadcast on the BBC, with the announcer stating: \"Listeners will want us to offer their loyal congratulations to Princess Elizabeth and the Royal Family on this happy occasion.\"\n Those at home could hear for themselves the crowd at Buckingham Palace shouting: \"We want Philip; we want the King.\"\n When Prince William was born 33 years later, on 21 June 1982, a notice on the gates of Buckingham Palace informed the world the Princess of Wales \"was safely delivered of a son\" and both mother and baby were \"doing well\".\n But the crowds outside pushed away any notion of decorum and formality, shouting: \"Nice one, Charlie, let's have another one\" while the announcement was immediately broadcast on the television and radio before headlining the next day's papers. \n Princess Diana defied tradition by leaving the hospital just 24 hours later, and standing on the steps to give the world a glimpse of the swaddled baby. The clamour for the first shot of the child was unprecedented.\n Yet, while the interest in Prince William's own birth was enormous, his own child's arrival is set to be like nothing the Royal Family has ever seen before. \n The duchess's pregnancy was revealed through an official announcement earlier than her predecessors because she suffered acute morning sickness. Public interest has been intense ever since.\n \"The British Monarchy has a website and a presence on social media, so the question is where do you put it first? The duke and duchess will have to put an announcement on the gates of the palace though because that's where the die-hard traditionalists always gather,\" explains royal expert Victoria Arbiter. \n The internet means that once this baby is born, it is guaranteed the news will be disseminated globally in mere seconds. Yet, this is just the beginning.\n \"They will have to pose for a family shot. It's important for them to do it. Part of them will want to hide away and have this personal time but wherever the duchess gives birth, the world's media will be waiting outside for them,\" Arbiter says.\n \"We have 24-hour news now as well as the internet - something we did not have when the Queen was born. This makes for an insatiable desire for news and for people to attempt to get that first shot of the baby - which will be worth a lot of money.\"\n \"But when the child comes, Prince William will do everything he can to protect that baby. He is ready to protect Kate and his family like a grizzly bear.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The announcement of royal births has always attracted huge public interest while the tradition reflects the importance of the succession.","datetime":"1841-11-09 12:00:00 +0100"}
