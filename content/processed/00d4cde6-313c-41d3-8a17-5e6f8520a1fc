Pigeons have homing instincts and will always fly back to wherever their nests are. \n The army made sure the pigeons nested near military bases. \n Soldiers transported the pigeons with them and tied messages to the birds' legs. On release, the pigeons then flew home, delivering the messages back to base. \n Telephones were used in the trenches because they could pick up and send Morse code between units. This allowed important messages to be delivered and ensured soldiers across the front knew the plans for defence and attack. \n Telephones were placed in different units and connected by wires to the same switchboard. This allowed soldiers on different parts of the battlefield to communicate with each other but the system could easily fail if the wires snapped or were broken by the enemy.\n Wireless (radio) was also used but this was more important at sea to pass messages from ship to ship. Wireless was also used by aircraft to transmit signals but they could only send, not receive, due to their weight.\n* Aerial cables delivered telephone or Morse code messages with lines laid on the ground or buried near the firing line. \n * Begbie lamp was used for flashing Morse code messages. \n * Two flags (one white and one blue) were used against light or dark backgrounds. \n * Electric lamps on a tripod stand were used at night. \n * Two types of flap or disc instruments opened and shut with the long and short pauses of the Morse code - the one with the three flaps attached to a spring could be attached to a tree or wall).\n * Heliograph with its mirrors, needed sunshine to transmit messages. \n * Whistle which could be used for signals with Morse code.\nA special electric Lucas signalling lamp was also used to get coded messages from soldier to soldier using the Morse code system. Unfortunately, this was also its biggest problem. As anyone could see the light, the enemy could work out what was being communicated if they managed to interpret the code. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at technology, communications and weapons.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How did soldiers communicate between units on the front line?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
