Falling ash preserved the forms of many of their bodies. \n Until that day, they would not have had any idea that the volcano was a danger, says Paul Roberts, curator of the British Museum's Pompeii exhibition.\n Vesuvius is thought to have lain dormant for the previous 700 years. There had been earth tremors for several days before the eruption, according to an eye-witness account made by the younger Pliny, a Roman administrator and poet. \n But ancient Romans thought these were caused by currents of air, and were unaware that they could be a warning of a volcanic eruption.\n All the evidence is that the eruption in AD79 caught the local population utterly unprepared.\n But as Vesuvius began emitting black clouds of ash, and the danger became more obvious, most people fled or sought shelter. So what did they reach for in the hours before the fatal eruption?\n There are many practical items like lamps and lanterns. Even before nightfall, the cities could have been plunged into darkness ahead of the main eruption which came shortly after midnight.\n Some people had their keys, clearly hopeful that they would be returning home. \n Hundreds of refugees from Herculaneum had taken shelter in the vaulted arcades at the beach, perhaps hoping to be rescued, clutching their jewellery and money. \n Among them was a young girl found with a charm bracelet, constructed of more than 40 charms from all over the Roman empire. She may have hoped it would bring her good luck. The bracelet would have had \"no financial value\", says Paul Roberts, \"but is a very poignant object, which must have had sentimental value for its owner.\" \n People took things that had personal meaning - a doctor was found with his medical kit, which included scalpels, forceps, and a needle. \"We can never know if this was to safeguard the tools of his trade, or a valiant attempt to help the wounded,\" says Roberts. \n Watch or visit...\n* Watch: Pompeii: The Mystery of the People Frozen in Time, broadcast on BBC One, 27 March 2013, afterwards on iPlayer \n * Watch: The Other Pompeii: Life and Death in Herculaneum broadcast on BBC Two, 21:00 BST, 2 April 2013\n * Visit: Life and death: Pompeii and Herculaneum at the British Museum, 28 March to 29 September 2013\n One woman was found with bags of jewellery, and gold and silver coins - more wealth than found with any other body. Around her neck was a large necklace, or \"body chain\", which she must have been particularly attached to, as it was the only piece of jewellery she was wearing. \n Along with more precious items, there was a single battered earring and fragments of an armlet - suggesting that she didn't have time to carefully choose what she took, but may have simply grabbed or tipped her jewels into a bag as she fled. \n The possessions of another young woman, found outside Pompeii's Nola gate, suggest that superstition and faith played their part as the victims tried desperately to escape from the rising heat and falling pumice. \n The \"Porta Nola\" girl carried a silver statuette of the Egyptian goddess Isis-Fortuna, protective silver amulets including one in the shape of a phallus which was thought to protect against the evil eye, and rings containing icons associated with luck.\n It is impossible to know whether she, or any of the victims, grabbed those objects at the last minute, but she had clearly tried to protect herself from bad fortune. \n The people of Pompeii and Herculaneum were ordinary people, says Roberts, ranging from the very wealthy to poor slaves, but they died in an extraordinary way. They must have assumed that life would continue as normal, but they were interrupted by a force beyond their control. \n And their reactions, he adds, may not have been so different from those of people caught up in recent catastrophes. \n Following floods in Buffalo Creek in the US in 1972, sociologist Kai Erikson studied what possessions people took with them as they left their homes. He says they represented \"a measure of security, an extension of self, a source of identity\", which he describes as \"the furniture of the self\".\n Similar findings followed the 2007 floods which affected the community of Toll Bar in Doncaster.\n Residents had little time to choose what to take with them when they were evacuated says Dr Lucy Easthope, an expert in disaster response. In hindsight, she says, they would either laugh or regret their choices. \n One woman snatched up her cockatiel as firefighters evacuated her. But she forgot to bring the bird's cage and had to spend hours in the rest centre holding her pet in her arms. Others picked up their televisions, but wished later they had taken precious family photos.\n People in Pompeii and Herculaneum were also found with impractical items, says Paul Roberts. Some had bulky silver pots, which would have made it hard to escape with any speed, but would have been seen as a valuable item that they could trade for food or money. \n In any case, the people killed at Pompeii and Herculaneum did not live long enough to regret what they chose. \n But one modern survivor of disaster has learned a vital lesson from his experience of fleeing after the earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima in 2011.\n Should he ever be displaced from his home again, Ryan McDonald only has to reach into his closet where possessions are separated, \"emergency things to the left and regular clothes to the right\".","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Remains at Pompeii and Herculaneum reveal a people overtaken by disaster, clinging to a few possessions.","datetime":"28 March to 29"}
