Dresses either had long, puff sleeves, or shorter sleeves that ended at the elbow. The collars and cuffs were often fringed with lace. \n Dark skirts were worn with a lacy, long-sleeved white blouse. Short-sleeved evening dresses were worn with long gloves. Women wore flat shoes or leather ankle-boots. High heel shoes only became popular after World War One.\n Outdoors, a woman in the early 1900s wore an ankle-length coat that came in tight at the waist. If it was very cold, she would pull a woollen shawl around her shoulders. Women often also wore a big hat, nicknamed a 'cartwheel' because the brim was so wide. Hats would be decorated with piles of feathers, artificial flowers and fruit, or even a whole bird!\n A woman from a poorer family wore a white blouse and an ankle-length plain skirt, with an apron tied around her waist. To keep warm, she'd add a woollen shawl, probably one she had knitted herself.\n Outdoors, women from poorer families wore hats too - lacy bonnets, or smaller and less flashy versions of the fine ladies' hats. Women kept their hats on indoors when visiting someone or going to church.\n Women wore their hair piled up high on the tops of their heads in a 'bun' shape. They might wrap their hair around a small, stuffed cushion, known as a 'rat', to make their bun look more luxuriant. Some hairstyles were kept in place with long metal hair pins.\n Teachers' notes to accompany the 'What clothes did people wear?' section","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out about the clothes that women wore in the early 1900s and during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
