It used a special system called 'triage' where sick soldiers were put into one of three possible groups:\n* Slightly injured - Soldiers who did not need much care. They were quickly given treatment wherever they were and then carried on fighting. \n * Need hospital - Soldiers who needed to be transported by ambulance to a hospital for treatment. They were taken in motorised or horse-driven ambulances to the nearest hospital base. \n * Beyond help - Soldiers who did not have much chance of getting better. They were made comfortable but little treatment was given as priority was given to others.\nCasualty clearing stations were set up close to the battlefields, some by the Red Cross. After being treated in the trenches, wounded soldiers would be taken first to a clearing station then moved on to a general hospital if they needed more treatment. \n Female volunteers who wanted to help were allowed to work as nurses at casualty clearing stations. Some drove ambulances. This was usually the closest they were allowed to get to the front line but it was still close enough that they might be hit by enemy fire. Most worked 14-hour days and sometimes even longer when there were lots of injured soldiers. The soldiers liked having women around because they reminded them of their mothers, wives and sisters. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at medicine during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How soldiers were treated on the frontline during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
