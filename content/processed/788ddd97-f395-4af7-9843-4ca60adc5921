The most recent series examines the risks attached to careless online activity for young people and the tragic and lasting consequences for one family.\n In episode one, two brothers, 12 and 14, stumble upon the scene of 15-year-old Florence Henderson's suicide. Foolishly, one of them takes a photo of her hanging, lifeless body and shares it on Twitter. \n The lads are questioned by police and despite the fact that they have caused distress to Florence's father, they are given an informal warning and allowed to go as they have clearly not been involved in her death or interfered with the crime scene. \n Section 1 refers to indecent or grossly offensive messages where there is an intention to cause distress or anxiety to the recipient.\n Section 4A refers to behaviour causing serious alarm or distress, or that has a substantial effect on a person's daily activities.\n Section 127 covers messages which are grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character sent through a \"public electronic communication network\".\n Mark Henderson, Florence's grieving father, suffers the indignity of hearing of her tragic death through social media.\n There is no one specific UK law which makes cyberbullying illegal. It can be considered a criminal offence under a range of different laws which identify worrying and inappropriate online behaviour. \n Online activities which may fall foul of the law include sending messages that are indecent, obscene or menacing, or that deliberately cause distress or anxiety to the person on the receiving end.\n However, the law varies in different parts of the UK.
