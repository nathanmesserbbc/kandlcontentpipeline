Boy Scout leaders helped organise collections.\n The conkers were sent by train to top-secret factories at Holton Heath in Dorset and King's Lynn in Norfolk. Around 3,000 tonnes of conkers were collected by Britain's children in 1917.\n The plan wasn't a great success. Conkers were a poor source of acetone, the chemical needed to make cordite.
