He realised that it was impossible to paint a ship in camouflage that would hide it from the sights of a submarine commander. Instead, he proposed that the \"extreme opposite\" was the answer.\n Rather than trying to make a ship vanish on the ocean waves, he developed a radical camouflage scheme that used bold shapes and violent contrasts of colour. His purpose was to confuse rather than conceal.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"Dr Sam Willis discovers how the British artist Norman Wilkinson developed dazzle camouflage to protect ships from German U-boats in WW1","datetime":"1970-01-01 12:00:00 +0100"}
