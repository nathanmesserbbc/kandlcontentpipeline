The festival, which was held at BBC North in Salford, addressed the question: \"What does Britain believe?\"\n Sessions examined subjects from faith in the media through to the Hillsborough disaster, as well as special editions of popular programmes The Big Questions and the Moral Maze. \n There was also a head-to-head between the Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks and the renowned scientist and prominent atheist Richard Dawkins. \n During the session the Chief Rabbi said that Dawkins' description of the \"Old Testament God\" was \"anti-semitic\", a charge which Dawkins rejected. \n The debate will be broadcast in full on BBC Parliament on Friday, 21 September at 21:00 BST.\n Delegates came from a range of backgrounds and included religious leaders, humanists and academics. Members of the public were able to watch sessions live via the BBC religion and ethics website and contribute to the debate via a Twitter hash tag, #bbcrethink.\n '96 names'\n On the second day of the festival the Right Reverend James Jones, Bishop of Liverpool, explained the work behind the Hillsborough Independent Panel's report which highlighted health and safety failings and how police statements had been altered. \n He explained that faith had driven him to accept the role as chair of the panel, but the tragedy of 15 April 1989 had also made him question God. \n Bishop Jones told delegates that he kept on his desk the names the 96 Liverpool fans who died as a result of overcrowding during the 1989 FA Cup semi-final, to remind him of the panel's purpose. \n He acknowledged that, as a church leader, he was expected to be independent and added that it was part of his role as community leader to provide spiritual help and support.\n Bishop Jones said the same role is played by all local spiritual leaders in their communities, regardless of their religious affiliation. He said that people may not be committed to a specific religious institution, but they are still spiritual and religious because, he argued, there is a religious instinct in everyone. \n In another of the sessions, panelists discussed the contentious topic of abortion. \n Regular panelists Claire Fox and Anne McElvoy, alongside presenter David Aaronovitch - from Radio 4's The Moral Maze - cross-examined two guests.\n Dr Sarah Chan, deputy director of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester, presented an ethical and philosophical case for abortions to be carried out throughout pregnancy. \n Dr Trevor Stammers, programme director in bioethics and medical law, St Mary's University College, Twickenham, argued there was no moral justification for abortion in any circumstances.\n There was also a special edition of The Big Questions, the BBC discussion programme hosted by Nicky Campbell, on the topic of religion in society, to be broadcast on BBC Parliament on Wednesday, 19 September, 18:00 BST.\n Religion 'on the box'\n In an exploration of the morality at the heart of EastEnders, one of the show's producers, Jenny Robins, said that broadcasters should tackle important and controversial story-lines and approach them with research-based zeal.\n The soap has tackled a number of difficult and controversial story-lines associated with religion and ethics in recent years. \n During a debate about religion on TV, independent broadcaster Roger Bolton argued that there was \"a liberal secular elite dominating the media in this country\". He contended that it was deemed to be acceptable to have comedy shows making fun of Christianity, but not of Islam and other religions. Ordinary people feel this is unfair, he argued.\n The BBC's head of Religion and Ethics, Aaqil Ahmed, said the media had a responsibility to increase understanding of different faiths before turning to comedy. He argued that comedy was inappropriate without there first being a foundation of knowledge.\n Lina Prestwood, from Channel Four, explained that although the channel does not have a religion commissioner, it tries to to infuse religion across the output and broadcasts a daily slot dealing with religious and ethical issues after the evening news, 4Thought.\n In a separate session, historian and broadcaster Bettany Hughes called for media coverage of religion to confront controversy. \n A poll commissioned for the festival showed that young people considered family the most important moral obligation. \n Almost 600 people, aged 16 to 24, were asked to choose the most important moral issue from a list of eight. Four per cent of those questioned cited having religious faith, whereas 49% chose looking after their family as most important. \n Reflecting on the results, Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, said that young people were impressed by authenticity, in particular by people who follow through on their actions and are not hypocritical.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"An event hosted by BBC Religion and Ethics at MediaCity in Salford explores the essential issues of faith, philosophy and ethics.","datetime":"21 September at 21"}
