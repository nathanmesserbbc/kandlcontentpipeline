But the war changed things for rich families too. Most young male servants went away to war, and some young female servants also left to work in factories. Some big family houses became military hospitals, for wounded soldiers.\n The very poorest families lived in run-down houses called slums. These were usually old buildings that were badly kept, dirty and overcrowded. Often several families had to share a toilet. A whole family might have to live in two rooms, using one as a bedroom where everyone slept - several children in one bed. \n Rich people had maids and other servants to do jobs like carrying coal, clearing out fires, and carrying buckets of water to fill a bath (some houses did not have water on tap). In most homes, the hardest work was probably on washday, because many people did their washing by hand, using soap, a brush, a ridged washboard and tub. Another unpleasant job was emptying someone's chamber pot (potty) in the morning. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at typical families during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Overview of how rich and poor families lived during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
