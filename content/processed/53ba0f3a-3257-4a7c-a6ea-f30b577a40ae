A family with seven or eight children was not unusual. However, by the outbreak of war in 1914, families were beginning to be smaller and more like the typical size of families today. \n The father was the head of the family and he was responsible for going out to work and providing for his wife and children. He was in charge of the family's finances and for paying the rent and the household bills. \n When war was declared in 1914, many men chose to go away to fight. However, many other men decided to stay at home and to continue to work and to look after their families. Then in 1916, a law called conscription was introduced because the Army needed more men to fight in the war. Conscription meant that men aged 18-41 were told to join the armed forces rather than it being their choice. At the beginning, only single men were conscripted but many married men also joined up as they felt it was their duty not just to their country, but to their family too.\n Before World War One began, women often worked as servants and cleaners. Once a woman married she was expected to give up work and to become a housewife. Her role was to look after the children and to cook and clean the family home. However, as men left to fight in the war, women had to take on jobs outside the home. Many women went to work in munitions factories making explosive 'shells' for big guns. Others went to work on farms in the countryside as Land Girls or in hospitals as nurses. As the war went on, women took on more and more men's jobs.\n During this period, unmarried or widowed single women, such as a sister of the father or mother, sometimes lived with the family. Often grandparents lived with their son or daughter's family. When war broke out, older relatives looked after the children when mothers were at work, while younger relatives were able to go out to work and to help with the costs of rent, food and fuel.\n Divorce was very unusual in the early twentieth century but there were still lots of single parent families because people died more often from disease. Medicine was not as advanced as it is today and so many people died in childbirth or from illnesses which are now treatable. Safety at work was also quite poor and so many people died in accidents at work. It was quite common for widows and widowers to remarry and to rebuild a family, so children often had step-parents and step-brothers and sisters.\n When war broke out, many more children lost both parents and became orphaned. Some would have a father who had died on the front line. Mothers or fathers could die due to illness or occasionally, women were killed due to working with explosives in munitions factories. If there were no other family members (such as an aunt or uncle) to look after the children, the orphans would go to live in an orphanage or a poor house with other people who did not have a home.\n Children in 1914 were expected to be very polite and respectful to adults. They were often described as being 'seen but not heard'. Life changed dramatically for many children as they became involved in supporting the war effort at home.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at typical families during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out what family life was like during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
