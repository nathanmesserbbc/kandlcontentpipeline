It is an important protective mechanism to run from danger but, fear can also make people flee from all situations of risk and challenge.\n Anyone who claims never to have been afraid is either a fool or a fantasist. \n Exercises and Readings\n* Take 10 minutes to relax and imagine yourself on that road with Jesus going to Jerusalem. What do you hear the disciples saying? What do you feel like inside?\n * Can you remember a time when you were afraid but refused to let your fear deter you? What did it feel like when fighting fear?\n * Is there any one thing that makes you afraid today? What might help you overcome that fear?\n * How does faith help when you feel afraid?\n * How might you help someone who is in the grip of anxiety and fear?\n No one would want to go on an expedition with a reckless person who did not have a healthy respect for danger. But then again no expedition would ever get started if fear is not faced and ultimately overcome.\n To be afraid is not to be a coward. To be afraid is to be human.\n Fear can entrap the mind and infect the imagination. \n Franklin D.Roosevelt famously said \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\" \n No-one ever conquered fear by running away. The pilgrimage of faith faces the deepest fears and yet is sustained to continue the journey to a greater freedom. \n Jesus turns towards Jerusalem and those who followed him were afraid. Jesus himself can have had no illusion about what lay on the road ahead. Jerusalem had a reputation for killing the prophets.\n Some of his followers wanted him to turn back. It must have been a temptation to take a different road and avoid the inevitable confrontation.\n Temptation and testing are constant challenges on the way to Jerusalem. Jesus faced his keenest fears even predicting his arrest and execution yet he did not turn back and he did not run away.\n Two of his followers, James and John, come asking for a share in his glory. They could not grasp that the true majesty of Jesus was not any worldly notion of power but his faithfulness as the servant of all. \n His glory lay in offering himself even to the point of death, overcoming his fear and refusing to be deflected from his path.\n His life and death would ultimately change the understanding of power not as authority to lord it over the nation but power to be the servant of the people.\n It is no accident that government today is run by Civil 'Servants' and by Government ' Ministers'.\n Jesus taught his followers, \"Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.\"\n Go before us to lead us, travel behind us to guard us and be above us to bless us on our journey, now and always.\n* Inside Lent: Introduction\n * Lent: Inside temptation (9th March)\n * Lent: Inside doubt (16th March)\n * Lent: Inside anger (23rd March)\n * Lent: Inside love (30th March)\n * Lent: Inside fear (6th April)\n * Lent: Inside hope (13th April)\n * Easter Day - Inside joy (20th April)\nFind out more about your nearest BBC local radio station and BBC Radio 4 Sunday Worship.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"BBC Radio 4's Sunday Worship and Local Radio make six journeys Inside Lent.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
