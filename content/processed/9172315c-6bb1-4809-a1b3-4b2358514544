In Egypt, he fought at the Battle of Toski in 1889. He also reorganised the Egyptian Police Force in 1890. He always set very high standards for himself and wanted everything to be done very accurately. This was where he gained the skills needed to become a strong leader. He impressed all of the people who worked with him. \n In 1896, Kitchener's leadership skills were noticed. He was made the Governor General of Sudan, a country in Africa that was partly controlled by Britain at the time, as a Lieutenant General. He started to rise up through the army ranks very quickly. In 1902, he became Commander-in-Chief in India. Then, in 1909, he was promoted again. This time he became a Field Marshall, one of the highest military ranks in charge of soldiers.\n When the war approached, he had become such an experienced and successful soldier that the British prime minister created a new role just for him as Secretary of State for War. He made Kitchener a member of his cabinet (the group of ministers who work closely with the prime minister in running the country).\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas for Lord Kitchener.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"What did Lord Kitchener do before World War One?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
