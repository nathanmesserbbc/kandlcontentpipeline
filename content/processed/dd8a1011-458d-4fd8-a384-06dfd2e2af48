Now children, women and older people at home were also in danger.\n 'Take Shelter Immediately'\n The raids changed the way people lived. In some parts of Britain, it became illegal to have a light showing from your house after dark. People had never before had to take shelter when an alarm sounded. \n The bombs often dropped far from their targets and ordinary people suffered. \n Many of the people who died in the first Gotha attack were women and children, shopping on an ordinary street in daylight. \n Events like this made people very angry and scared. They were angry with the Germans, but they were also scared because they felt the Government was not protecting them. \n \"\n I have lived through an air raid and I feel life has been worth living.\"\n Germany planned air raids to destroy British cities and terrify British people. \n However, some people enjoyed seeing the strange Zeppelins. After London's fifth raid the Evening News said many Londoners felt disappointed at having 'missed the show'.\n Special church services were organised and the names of those who had died were read out. Many people were comforted by the prayers and by the love and kindness they were shown. People prayed for the war to end. \n 'All Clear'\n Factories reported that the day after an air raid, people did not work as hard because they were upset. In one town, a special hospital was opened to care for children distressed by the raids.\n By the end of the war, almost 1,500 British citizens had been killed by the German air raids, and over 3,400 had been injured. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at air raids during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"When bombs began to fall on civilians during World War One, war became much more frightening for British people","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
