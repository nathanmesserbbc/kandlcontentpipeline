EXTRA!'\n However, on the whole journalists censored themselves since they supported the war and were strongly patriotic. They often wrote stories in a way that made the British and their Allies look successful. \n Some national newspapers carried a list of officers and men killed in battle, and local papers would list those in their area who were dead or missing. It all made very sad reading, particularly since so many soldiers and sailors were young men.\n 'Read all about it!'\n As well as reports about the war, there were also sections on how to make food go further or how to be a good housekeeper despite the shortages. \n War reporters\n When the war started, journalists were banned from going to the Western Front and telling people about it. \n However, many reporters ignored this ban and found secret ways to travel to the war. One journalist, Basil Clarke, hid on a train full of French soldiers going to fight. \n In April 1915, the ban was stopped and some journalists were allowed to report on the front.\n Some people wrote letters commenting on less important matters such as the style of uniforms women were now wearing. There were stories to cheer people up too. \n 'It's a long, long way to Tipperary'\n One journalist wrote about an Irish regiment marching through a French town singing a song called \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary\". \n The news spread to other soldiers and to singers in Britain and soon, everyone knew the tune because of the newspaper story. It became one of the most popular songs in World War One.\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at communication 100 years ago.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"How newspapers shaped World War One on the home front","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
