Their planes flew slowly and sometimes crashed. \n Pilots sat in open 'cockpits,' wearing thick coats, gloves and helmets to keep warm. They had no parachutes because it was thought that parachutes would encourage pilots to 'give up' rather than keep on fighting. The parachutes at the time were very heavy and it was feared that they would stop aircraft being able to take off!\n Because using aircraft in war was quite a new idea, pilots originally belonged to the Army's Royal Flying Corps or the Royal Naval Air Service.\n Air battles became known as 'dogfights' and the top fighter pilots were 'aces'. Early fighter aircraft had only two seats, with a man sitting in the rear controlling the guns. Dogfights were extremely difficult because the pilot would have to dodge other enemy aircraft while listening to the gunner telling him where to fly.\n In 1918, the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service joined forces to become the Royal Air Force. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the front line during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The story of the men who joined the Air Force in World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
