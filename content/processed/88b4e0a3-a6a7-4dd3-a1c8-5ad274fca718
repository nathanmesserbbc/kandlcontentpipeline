One way they can do this is by sending you an email with a link. If you receive an email from a stranger, think before clicking on a link or an attachment.\n The risk of having your webcam hacked is also higher if you don't have up-to-date anti-virus software on your computer and other software is not kept up-to-date. So make sure you have the latest versions of security software on all your devices including tablets and smartphones.\n It is important to avoid putting webcams in private areas such as bedrooms. When webcams are not in use don't forget to unplug them, cover the lens or point it at a blank wall.\n Think before you cam\n If you use your webcam to communicate with people you meet online, it is important to consider how well you know them. If you are having a private conversation are you sure they are the only person who can see you?\n Also consider whether there's a chance that they could be recording what you are saying or doing - you might not want them to post a video of your chat on a social network or share it using their mobile phone.\n Remember, once it is out there you may never be able to delete all copies of it. It is against the law for someone to intrude on your privacy in this way and offenders can be prosecuted under the Computer Misuse Act.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Webcams make it possible to keep in touch with friends and family where ever they may be.
