In episode two, DI Bird visits the girl's school to talk about the damage caused by online bullying. \n Craven episodes 1 and 2 are still available to watch. \n Cyberbullies can be very determined and will try any means possible to reach their victim. Although social networking sites can be a great way of keeping in touch they also mean that young people can be tempted to over-share details of their personal lives, which in turn can make them more vulnerable to bullying.\n In part 3, the police step up their hunt to find the cyber bullies who appear to be implicated in the death of Florence Henderson and receive a lesson in social media. \n Be careful about what you share. Don't make yourself vulnerable by exposing to much of yourself online - 'over-sharing' can be a key factor in how bullies get information which they can use against you.\n* Never give out your address, mobile number or email address on a public site. Think twice before uploading photos or videos. Remember that once you've put a picture of yourself online, other people may be able to see it an download it. \n * Take control of your online profiles - choose who can see them and who can leave comments. For example, use the privacy and security settings on social networking sites so that only friends and family can see them.\n * Consider using a nickname instead of your real name if you are using Twitter, a chat room or online forum.\n * If you're having a personal chat on a social networking site, the best option is to send a private message (this is almost always possible). Otherwise, you could end up sharing your conversation with millions of other users.\n * Don't tell anyone your passwords for the sites you use. If a bully gets hold of these details they can access your account and can leave abusive content on your profile page or send abusive content to your contacts while pretending to be you.\n * Always sign out and close the web page once you have finished using a website. If you are using a shared computer or one in a public place, make sure you log out and shut down the computer.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Det Insps Bird and Watende receive a briefing on the power of social media","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
