A group of artists, including Joshua Reynolds and Francis Hayman, would go there to eat, drink and chew over the world's ills. This habit led them to the realisation that they needed greater control over exhibiting and selling their own work. \n Johan Zoffany, The Portraits of the Academicians of the Royal Academy, 1771-72, detail\n* This painting purports to be painted during a life class, with two semi-clothed male models present.\n * It features the founding members of the Royal Academy.\n * Among them is Zoffany himself, anatomist William Hunter, landscape painter Richard Wilson, Sir Joshua Reynolds (complete with silver ear trumpet) and academic and painter Francis Hayman. \n * The two female founders are present only virtually, in the imposing form of two portraits hanging on the wall.\n * It would have been considered indecent for Swiss portraitist and English flower painter Mary Moser to be present in the same room as nude males. \n * Watch a slideshow of Zoffany works at Your Paintings\n In the middle of the 18th century there was little in the way of patronage for home-grown artists in the UK. Unlike in Europe, there was no powerful Catholic Church to commission great pieces, and the English aristocracy of the time was content to tour the Continent and hoover up Renaissance masters and ancient art for their collections.\n In this sort of climate, 'modern' artists realised they needed to act for themselves. \n Various groups were forming, among them the Society of Arts (founded 1754), which was soon abandoned by the Turk's Head contingent who upped the ante by proclaiming themselves the Society of Artists of Great Britain in 1761. They held a hugely successful exhibition, which revealed a burgeoning upper middle class market.\n \"And then, as is often the case when you put a bunch of creatives in one room,\" observes Pomeroy, \"the organisation collapsed under infighting and bickering over position.\" \n What emerged, with famous portraitist Sir Joshua at the helm, was the Royal Academy of Arts. It was founded by King George III in 1768, and mimicked state-funded ventures in Italy, the Netherlands and France.\n The 34 founding members were prominent artists and architects, among them two women, Mary Moser and Angelica Kauffman.\n The aim was to provide a space for open exhibition and debate, and to establish a school of art that would foster expertise and also support members in lean times. \n \"It was a strange cross between a union, a guild, a club and a lobbying organisation\" says Pomeroy. Unlike the European models it ran entirely on its own wits, with no government funding. It continues to do so and, as befits an organisation created in the 1700s, there is still a fairly laborious membership process.\n There are no more than 80 Royal Academicians at any time, who add the initials RA to their professional names for the duration, along with a growing number of Senior Academicians who are aged 75 and over.\n Each is an artist by profession and new members are proposed and seconded by existing RAs, a group which now include names such as as Norman Foster, Tracey Emin, Antony Gormley, David Hockney and Anish Kapoor. It has previously boasted everyone from Constable and Gainsborough, to Turner and Stanley Spencer. \n The Royal Academy's first annual exhibition opened in April 1769, with entry costing one shilling. This was enough to keep out, as one newspaper wag put it, ''the noxious effluvia of the vulgar herd\". 136 paintings had been entered for submission and they were placed on the walls in a 'salon hang', which is to say rammed to the joists, a style unfamiliar to modern gallery-goers.\n Ten years later, such was the public fever for new art that there were 1200 paintings to place. This meant a tricky political process, as well as an artistic one, for the 'Hangmen' - their job it was to create a room that the eye could follow while causing as little offence as possible to understandably sensitive artists. \n By then the Academy was based in Somerset House. The purpose-built Great Room, beautifully lit by generous windows, was the most prestigious place to be shown.\n A dado rail running horizontally about eight feet from the ground was the perfect position to be seen by jostling visitors, leading to much competition to get \"on the line\".\n Viewers could creep forward to view smaller works placed near the skirting boards, but anything near the very high ceiling was dismissed as having been \"skied\" - visible only to those with strong necks and stronger eyesight. \n Now in its 245th year, the Summer Exhibition still shows approximately the same number of pieces, but receives (at £25 per submission) 13,000 entries from artists, both professional and amateur, from all over the world. \n Thomas Banks, R.A., Anatomical Crucifixion (James Legg), 1801\n* Three Royal Academicians - sculptor Thomas Banks and painters Benjamin West and Richard Cosway - were determined to demonstrate that most depictions of the Crucifixion were incorrect.\n * No crucifixions had ever been captured from life or, perhaps more accurately, death.\n * They planned to acquire the corpse of one Joseph Legg.\n * Legg was an 80-year-old Irishman sentenced to be hanged on 2 November 1801.\n * Immediately after his death, Legg's still-warm body was taken to a hastily-erected tent nearby and nailed to a cross\n * This was to demonstrate how a real corpse hangs in such circumstances.\n * Two casts of the corpse were made; one with flesh, one flayed or écorché.\n * This écorché cast is still on dislay in the RA's life-drawing room\n Each one is scrutinised by that year's Hanging Committee of eight men and women and the President of the Academy, over what Edith Devaney, Head of Summer Exhibition and Curator of Contemporary Projects describes as \"a very intensive and exhausting week\". \n Fellow academicians are granted automatic inclusion, but otherwise selection is based on a purely visual reckoning, with no names or value attached to the work as it passes through the room. Committee members, according to Devaney, take their role very seriously indeed. \"Each exhibit represents a huge amount of emotional involvement on the part of the artist, and that must be respected. They see some really rather wonderful things and this year's exhibition co-ordinator, printmaker Norman Ackroyd, would stop the pieces that interested him to discuss technique and concept.\" \n Many pieces are shortlisted to go up to the gallery space, but fail to make it to the walls because the Hanging Committee can't blend them into a cohesive whole.\n Some artists, Devaney says, are cheered to have progressed that far, but she admits the situation is a difficult one. \"It's not something that they would come back to us to complain about. I suppose it's like actors going for auditions and being rejected. It's very tough.\"\n Indeed, many of the unwanted pieces are given a second chance to sell by the \"Not The Royal Academy\" show, run by a South Bank gallery. \n \"Almost for as long as the Academy has been around,\" says Mark Pomeroy, \"it has been attacked for its choices. Critics would scream 'the Academy is moribund!' and accuse it of having a 'monopoly on walls'. But when it began there wasn't even a National Gallery. The Academy schools were the environments that created the very artists - such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - who would later rebel against it. And if you think about it, that's exactly as it should be.\"\n Watch a Culture Show special about The Royal Academy on BBC iPlayer until Tuesday 18 June.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The origins of Britain's Royal Academy and its effect on art and artists","datetime":"1801-11-02 12:00:00 +0100"}
