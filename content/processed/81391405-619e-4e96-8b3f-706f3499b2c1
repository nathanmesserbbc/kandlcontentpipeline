All the clocks were put back one hour, so the evenings would be lighter. The aim was to save fuel and give people more time to work in the fields. It meant children had to get up an hour earlier for school, too.\n Glossary\n As most homes did not have hot running water, it meant that children had to wash in a bowl using a jug of cold water before setting off for school. If their mother was working an early shift at a munitions factory, they might have to make their own breakfast and get any younger children ready for school.\n Before they went to school, children might have to stand in a queue at the butcher's shop, until their mother got back from work and took their place. They'd get their knuckles rapped with a ruler though, if it was after nine o'clock and they were late for lessons. As they ran to school, they'd pass posters on the walls calling on young men to join the army, or telling families not to waste food.\n The school day\n At school, as well as ordinary lessons, children would help with war work. They might knit scarves or socks to send to soldiers, collect tin cans for recycling, or work on the school's vegetable plot, growing food for school dinners. \n When lessons ended at four o'clock, if they had a few pennies they could buy tea from the National Kitchen. They'd get a dollop of stew, or some 'pease pudding' (mushy peas) in a bowl they'd brought with them. They would carry the hot food home to eat.\n In the evenings, children played outside with their friends, read, or did jobs around the house. If their house had a garden or a yard, they might work weeding and watering the family's vegetable plot. Lots of families kept chickens so they could have fresh eggs. It was often a child's job to feed the chickens, collect the eggs - and clean up the muck!\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes to accompany the 'How was the day structured?' section","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out what a typical day was like for children growing up during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
