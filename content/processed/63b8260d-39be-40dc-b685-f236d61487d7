Watch Mark's video to find out how.\n It's a beautiful clear night; the stars are dazzling the skies, the Moon hangs proud above and you even catch a glimpse of Jupiter millions of miles away in space. \n How do you capture the beauty and wonder of this night sky on a camera? \n It isn't as hard as you might think to capture stunning pictures of the night sky. Some of the most beautiful photos of space have been taken by amateurs. \n So if you're inspired to give astrophotography a go, follow our tips to achieve the best results with your digital camera.\n There are three key settings to think about when capturing objects in the dark night sky. \n Aperture measures the size of the hole in your lens that lets light into the camera - you can adjust this using your camera's f-stop or f-ratio setting. \n When taking photos of dark objects at night, it's generally recommended to use a LOW f-stop, which gives a large aperture to allow more light through. But beware, as photos taken with the maximum aperture may not be very crisp. \n Shutter speed, or exposure time, defines how long the shutter stays open whilst taking a single photo. \n A longer exposure allows light into the camera for a longer time. However, since the Earth is rotating, you'll start to see trails of objects such as stars as they appear to move through the sky with a static camera if the shutter is open for longer than 15-30 seconds.\n ISO on your digital camera indicates the sensitivity of the image sensor. \n A higher ISO number means more sensitivity - this allows you to capture darker objects, but you may have a 'noisier', grainier photo. You'll need to experiment to find the perfect balance between sensitivity and noise. \n Stargazing LIVE can be seen on BBC Two at 8pm on 7, 8 and 9 January 2014.
