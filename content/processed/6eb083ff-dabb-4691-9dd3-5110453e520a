Through necessity women were now allowed to deliver the post as well. \n No one thought the war would last long but by 1916, it was clear the men would not be back to their jobs for some time. \n The Post Office decided that women should have uniforms too. They wore a blue hat, a heavy blue coat and skirt and boots. In bad weather, they also wore a waterproof cape.\n With so many men away from home, a huge number of letters and cards had to be delivered. \n Two billion letters\n The Army Postal Service handled all the post going to and from troops in Europe at their special sorting office called the Home Depot. \n To deal with the huge amount of wartime post (2 billion letters and 114 million parcels) the Home Depot became that the largest wooden building in the world at the time. \nThroughout the war, posting a letter had cost a penny, and it had been that price for 75 years. In 1918, the price increased by half a penny to 1Â½ d.\n A soldier could also send field postcards. These had no pictures, just some printed sentences and soldiers had to select the right message. \n It was a quick way to let people at home know all was well and that their letter or parcel had arrived. \n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at communication 100 years ago.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out how post played an important part of World War One, from letters home to female posties","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
