All these years I've never moved away from that.\" \n In 2000 he recorded a soundtrack for Fritz Lang's Metropolis and subsequently he added classical music to the mix, playing his back catalogue with an orchestra in 2005. \n Released in 1927, Metropolis is the German director's best known work - a dystopian sci-fi tale set in a city of the future. Its lavish futuristic sets and visionary themes have since influenced filmmakers, artists and musicians.\n The film Blue Potential documents his classical-techno collaboration with the Montpelier Philharmonic Orchestra.\n \"I've always been fond of classical music,\" says Mills. \"I watch a lot of films and you can't help but notice the soundtrack in your favourite films. So I became aware of John Williams through Star Wars. \n \"With the Blue Potential project we were looking for the answer to an equation - what would happen if you put electronic music with an orchestra.\n Woman in the Moon &amp; Rockets\n* Rocket pioneer Hermann Oberth was a scientific consultant on the film\n * The film uses a ten to zero countdown to launch as a dramatic device\n * Oberth was commissioned to build and launch a rocket as publicity around its 1929 premiere\n * Wernher von Braun, Oberth's assistant, later became the central figure in rocket development\n * Von Braun led the 'rocket team' that developed the V-2 ballistic missile during WWII\n * He later developed the Redstone rocket and was chief NASA scientist for the Saturn V\n * The Apollo programme used the Saturn V booster rocket to deliver humans to the moon in 1969\n \"I didn't realise how interested people were in other mediums and other art forms until I did something myself. When I did Metropolis, in a short period of time I was contacted by so many people, film directors and others. I know that there's a lot of room for advancement for electronic music.\n \"I'm especially interested in films that were made in the early half of the last century. It was a very transitional time, things were changing all the time - every 5 years there was a whole different scenario, the world was really... spinning.\"\n His latest work is with another of Lang's films. Released in 1929, Frau im Mond or Woman in the Moon is a science fiction melodrama that depicts multi-stage rocket travel to the moon.\n Travelling to the moon had been shown on film before, but this film brought the latest developments in rocket technology to a mass audience just 26 years after the Wright Brothers' first powered aeroplane flight.\n \t\"\n We are the children of Fritz Lang and Werner von Braun. We are the link between the '20s and '80s.\"\n \"I try to understand not only the film but to study the director as well. And to look at the time and the context in which the film was made.\n \"So with Woman On the Moon, that was really the first time those audiences had seen an impression of what the moon could be like. It was just as astonishing for them, as it was for the whole world to see it laid out so graphically on a big screen. So I had to consider all that, and make the music really in that respect in a very timeless way - not of the year 2012. Something that could fit in that time, but also now.\n \"The least I am supposed to do is transcribe how I feel about the future onto techno music. That's what I want to do and I'm prepared to do that whether I never work on another film or work with another orchestra.\"\n And on ambitions to soundtrack other films, Mills concludes, \"I'd love to do Frankenstein. And I'd like to work on M by Fritz Lang - particularly that one, as the original was made without a music soundtrack.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Detroit musician Jeff Mills brings techno's future facing sounds to Fritz Lang's 1929 film The Woman in the Moon","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
