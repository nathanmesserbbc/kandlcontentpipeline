Since opposites attract the north pole of a magnetised needle is attracted towards it.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Mark Miodownik shows you in his step-by-step guide how to magnetise a needle to create a working compass","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
