Not the man commonly regarded as Jesus's earthly father, but the less well-known St Joseph of Cupertino - patron saint of astronauts.\n One important role of a saint is to act as a sort of \"middleman\" for prayer. This concept, called \"intercession\", is central to the cult of saints, especially in the Catholic Church.\n It means the faithful can ask saints to pray for them. This is believed to make the prayer more likely to be heard as saints are in Heaven and, thus, closer to God.\n This idea has led to particular saints becoming patrons of certain places, jobs or groups of people. There are patron saints for brewers, tax collectors, social workers and, indeed, astronauts.\n So how does someone who lived in the 17th Century become the patron saint of astronauts? And what other unusual examples of sainthood can offer insight?\n Joseph of Cupertino is the patron saint of air travellers, aviators, astronauts and test takers. \n More unusual saints:\n* St Albinus of Angers, patron saint against pirate attack (Feast day: 1 March)\n * St Gertrude of Nivelles, patron saint of cats and against the fear of mice (Feast day: 17 March)\n * St Expeditus, patron saint against procrastination (Feast day: 19 April)\n * St Guinefort, the dog, patron saint of infants (Feast day: 22 August)\n Legend has it that that on 4 October, 1630 the Italian town of Cupertino held a procession on the feast day of St Francis of Assisi. Joseph was helping when he suddenly soared into the sky and remained hovering over the crowd. \n This particular episode of St Joseph's life might explain why he is considered the protector of astronauts, but other factors apply.\n Rt Rev Kieran Conry, Bishop of Arundel and Brighton Diocese and Chair of the Department for Evangelisation and Catechesis, explains: \"Traditionally patron saints were probably made through popular and local devotion. \n \"But more recently in Church history, designations of patron saints are made officially. The Pope will propose that a saint becomes a patron of a particular group, geographical area, life experience or trade.\n \"In addition to that, most Catholic individuals or groups will also adopt their own patron saint(s) as role models to match or fit their specific circumstances. \n \"For example, some might feel closely connected to a saint because they share the same name.\"\n Archbishop of Seville and one of the most learned men of his era, Isidore put together an encyclopaedia of all the earthly knowledge of the 7th Century, called Etymologiae.\n He also wrote a dictionary, a history of the Goths and the Vandals, and a history of the world since the Creation.\n Because of his encyclopaedic knowledge and his desire to make information accessible to as wide an audience as possible, in 2006 he was declared by the Vatican patron saint of the internet, as well as of computers and computer technicians.\n Bishop Conry recalls another similar example.\n \"St Gabriel became - designated so in 1951 - the patron saint of broadcasting, as he was God's messenger to the Virgin Mary,\" he says.\n As well as looking after taxi drivers, Saint Fiacre can be invoked to offer protection against, or treatment of, sexually transmitted diseases.\n \t\"\n Many of the saints died seemingly complete failures, perhaps with their life's project in tatters, with often what they said or wrote misunderstood\"\n The reason behind this curious patronage could be the hospice for sick travellers that Fiacre built in the French town of Meaux. Thanks to his knowledge of herbs and medicine, the legend says that he could cure, among others, sexually transmitted diseases.\n It may appear bizarre that the result of seemingly un-Christian behaviour is granted a patron saint, but saints come from all walks of life and are examples of how existence can be turned upside-down.\n \"Many of the saints died seemingly complete failures, perhaps with their life's project in tatters, with often what they said or wrote misunderstood,\" says Bishop Conry.\n \"Those who investigate the case for making someone a saint are not looking for the candidate to be absolutely perfect and successful in every way - in their background (their pre-conversion profession or trade perhaps) daily life, writings and so on.\n \"That said, evidence of a very serious sin against charity would halt their cause for sainthood.\n \"The fact that saints weren't perfect means that it is far easier for us today to identify with them as role models and evidence of their imperfections can be a source of hope.\"\n What makes a saint?\n Christian saints are people of holiness. Indeed, the Greek and Latin words commonly translated as \"saint\" (agios and sanctus) simply mean \"holy\" - a word to describe a person who is admired by his or her peers. \n The earliest Christians believed that all the faithful are \"called to be saints\" (Romans 1:7), but in the second and later centuries communities began to single out martyrs who had died under persecution as heroes of the faith. \n By the 4th Century each Christian community had its own local heroes. Women, men, and children who had lived lives of holiness and wisdom became saints by acclamation - through the spontaneous outpouring of affection from their communities - once they had died. \n But communities sometimes argued, and bishops tried to put a stop to this by organizing a formal process for giving their seal of approval.\n In the ninth and tenth centuries, the Bishop of Rome began to receive requests from other Latin-speaking churches, to confirm the decisions made by local bishops. \n Over time, the cult of certain saints grew far beyond the regions where they had lived and died, while others remained local, unheard of except by those close to home. Still others were adopted by the guilds of medieval craftsmen as holy patrons, the origin of our modern patron saints.\n A pious and devoted wife and mother, Frances of Rome was a wealthy Italian woman who lived in between the 14th and 15th centuries - about 400 years before the first car was invented.\n Despite her privileged position, she was said to live in modesty and collecting alms for the poor.\n Legend has it that, whenever she ventured into the streets of Rome at night, she was accompanied by a guardian angel that lit the way for her.\n Frances, who died in 1440, was canonised in 1925 and made patron of car drivers. \n To this day, hundreds of drivers gather in the streets of Rome on St Frances's day to receive a formal blessing with their vehicle, proving that someone who lived in the 14th Century can still have an important role in the lives of contemporary men and women.\n \"The number of years that a saint has been a saint plays no role in determining their current importance in Catholic life,\" says Bishop Conry.\n \"The story of the lives of the saints and their writings are available to help everyone in their journey of life, whether a saint lived in the first century AD or was recently canonised.\n \"That said, if a new saint is particularly associated with an individual or group, they will naturally feature higher on that individual or group's consciousness, than a saint that they feel no connection with.\"\n Drogo, who was born in the 12th Century in Flanders, became a pilgrim in his early teens. His mother died of childbirth, which made him feel incredibly guilty and triggered his vocation to become a penitential pilgrim.\n He travelled to Rome several times and it was during one of these pilgrimages he developed a condition that left him severely disfigured.\n As he was so unpleasant to look at, the residents of the French village of Sebourg built him a small cell attached to his church, where he lived for the rest of his life.\n Despite this seemingly miserable existence, the Church hopes that some people might still find solace in learning about saints like Drogo.\n Bishop Conry explains: \"The truth that is being affirmed in the practice of having a patron saint is that everyone, whatever their circumstances, wherever they might find themselves, is not alone. \n \"It affirms that someone has gone to that place or circumstance before them and can pray for them, that there is help and hope in every situation.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"There is a saint for almost everything.
