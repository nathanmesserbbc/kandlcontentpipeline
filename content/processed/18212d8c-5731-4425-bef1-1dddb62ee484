The Navy also needed to use fishing trawlers to patrol the coast looking out for enemy vessels and searching for mines. \n The 'Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve' were seamen from the Merchant Navy who could be called on to help the Royal Navy during a war. Many fishermen were also reservists and so were able to keep fishing while also helping the Navy and the war effort. \n Did you know?\n* The Coastguard Service started in 1822 and was set up to prevent smuggling, defend the coast and help the Royal Navy when needed. \n * In 1925 coastguards main roles shifted towards saving lives, salvaging wrecks and watching over the foreshores.\nBefore the war, coastguards were the guardians of Britain's coastlines. They looked out for boats and ships that got into trouble in rough seas and they would try to rescue their crews. They also took charge of wrecks and helped to salvage (save) the cargo of wrecked boats and ships that had sunk. \n The Admiralty was in charge of the Coastguard Service and coastguards became an arm of the Navy. When war broke out the coastguards played a vital role in helping the war effort and looked after the foreshores of Britain watching for signs of the enemy. Coastguards were trained to signal messages from land to ships at sea from Port War signal stations. This enabled the quick transfer of important information and orders between the Admiralty and ships.\n The coastguard patrols also escorted (protected) merchant ships with carrying supplies and munitions and also hospital ships bringing wounded soldiers back home to Britain.\n During the war, lots of people were needed as lookouts and Boy Scouts were recruited to help. All along the coastline and on hilltops, they watched the horizon carefully, raising the alarm if airships (zeppelins), bombers (enemy planes) or ships were seen heading towards Britain.\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The different types of coastal roles men had during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
