But new light is being shed on a special breed of men who fought perhaps the most terrifying war along the Western Front. Their job was not to charge over the top of the trenches into No Man's Land, but to sink explosive-packed tunnels deep beneath it.\n The allied tunnelling companies operated in such secrecy that little was known of their exploits for years after the war. Working in total silence up to 100ft underground they set out to detonate mines beneath the enemy's trenches.\n At each step of the way they had to search out and destroy German tunnellers busy digging the other way. Remarkably this deadly war of nerves was waged by civilians with little or no military training. And they were led by an eccentric Tory MP and millionaire.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"Peter Barton presents a guide to the underground battles of World War One.","datetime":"1917-06-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
