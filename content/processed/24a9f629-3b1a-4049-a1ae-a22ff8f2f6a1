When did people start playing? Why did the Victorians encourage and enjoy team sports so much? Pupils might make a timeline showing important events in football, such as the oldest clubs, the start of the Football League and the first FA Cup final.\n Children could discuss the difference between 'amateur' and 'professional' and what these words meant in sport when Walter was growing up. Why was it a big step for Walter to become a professional player? Did being an amateur have anything to do with social class or wealth?\n You could ask pupils to compare life for Walter as a footballer with the lives of top players today. What do children think might be the biggest differences?\n Walter was usually the only non-white player on the pitch. He was the target for racist abuse at least once in his career. How do pupils think this was this regarded by the spectators? How do they think Walter dealt with his feelings? Invite pupils to give their opinions, backing them up with references to accounts of Walter's life they have read. \n Do the children think there has been progress since Walter's time in dealing with racism in football? How do clubs approach the issue today? The children could find out more about anti-racism initiatives such as the Kick it Out campaign.\n Ask pupils to make a chain of paper figures to represent Walter in each of the different kits he wore during his footballing career. The children could track down information about each team's kit online. Can they find any photographs of footballers from the early 1900s?\n For the teams that still survive, the children could go on to make paper figures to show how Walter would look in the modern team colours.\n How have football kit designs changed since the early 1900s? What do pupils consider to be the biggest change?\n You could invite pupils to design a football trophy as a memorial to Walter Tull. You could ask: 'What form should the trophy take? What materials would you use? What wording would you put on the trophy?'\n Children could go on to make prototypes of their trophy ideas and the class could vote on which design they think is the most effective. Pupils could then co-operate to produce a finished version of this design.\n The class could challenge another class to a football match in Walter's memory. The finished trophy could be presented at the end of the match.\n Useful links\n* Crossing the white line: The Walter Tull Story\n * 'For Whom The Bell Tulls' - Edited transcript of John Fennelly's 2009 'Hotspur' article\n Pupils could discuss what life would have been like in rural Kent when Walter was born: no cars, no planes, no electricity in most homes and people working with horses in the fields. \n Children could write a letter home, as if they were Walter's father, Daniel. What would he tell friends in Barbados about his new life and his new family in England?\n Walter lost both his parents while still a child. His step-mother decided it was best for him and his brother to go to an orphanage. The class could talk about the issues around this event. How must Walter have felt? What were Edwardian orphanages like? Pupils could find out more from websites and books.\n Children could write a letter from Walter in London to his family in Kent. What would he have found different? In London, he would have seen rich families and very poor families. How would these people's lives have been different? Walter was in London when Queen Victoria died in 1901. How would he react to the news of her death?\n You might use a timeline to link Walter's life and career to the outbreak of World War One and his part in the war. The children could add dates such as when war started, when Walter joined the Army, his first battles, his time back in Britain, his commission as an officer and his death.\n Ask the children to put pins into a wall map of Britain and a wall map of Europe to show significant places in Walter's life: there are many places mentioned on the BBC Schools webpage about Walter. The children could stick labels next to each pin with the place name and the date Walter was there.\n Using a single thread, members of the class could trace Walter's journey through life from one place to another, winding the thread around each pin in the map, until the final complicated route is revealed.\n Ask pupils to list the countries Walter visited, both as a footballer and a soldier. Which languages were spoken in these countries? How could Walter have made himself understood?\n Groups of pupils could compile a set of useful phrases for a footballer visiting South America (for example, 'Where is the football ground?' or 'Where can I train?') and a soldier serving in France or Italy (for example, 'Are you wounded?' or 'Where are you hurt?') The children could use online sites to find out how to write and pronounce these phrases in the appropriate language.\n The groups could teach their chosen phrases to the rest of the class. You could compile all the children's research into a class phrase book.\n Walter's grandfather was a slave in the West Indies. Children could locate West Africa and the West Indies on a map. The children could find out more about the slave trade from books and websites. Why were slaves taken to places such as the West Indies? What work did they do? When and how was the British Empire's trade in slaves brought to an end?\n You could brief pairs of children to find out more about the lives of Walter Tull and other significant figures of the war years, using information from the BBC Schools World War One content, as well as BBC Primary History's Famous People content. \n Hold a class debate to decide the question: 'Who was the most historically significant figure of World War One?' Encourage pupils to put forward a case for the historical figure they have researched. The speakers will also need to explain what they consider 'historic significance' to be. \n Encourage the listeners to ask questions of the speakers that compare the competing claims of the different historical figures. At the end of the debate, the class could vote to decide the answer.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Teachers' notes and classroom ideas to accompany the 'Walter Tull' resources.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
