They worked with war patients at home and abroad. \n One hospital was run entirely by women. Endell Street Military Hospital in London was set up by Dr Flora Murray and Dr Louisa Garrett Anderson. They were both suffragettes which means they believed in women having the right to vote. \n The hospital was very busy, admitting sometimes as many as 80 casualties a day. Its surgeons were performing as many as 20 operations in one day. More than 24,000 soldiers were treated there.\n Elsie Inglis was a Scottish doctor who worked for an organisation called Scottish Women's Hospitals. \n In 1914, Elsie offered to help but the Army did not permit women doctors so she set up a medical unit in France instead. Elsie sent 14 teams of women volunteers to give medical help on the battlefields. \n In 1915 Elsie went to Serbia, where Serbs were fighting Germans and Austrians. She faced many hardships, dangerous battles, freezing weather and being arrested as a spy. \n From Serbia, Elsie went to Russia to work as a war doctor. Elsie returned to Britain in November 1917 due to cancer and she died shortly after her return. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at women's roles on the front line during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out about the work of female war doctors during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
