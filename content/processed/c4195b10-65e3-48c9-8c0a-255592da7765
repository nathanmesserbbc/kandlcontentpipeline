It was decided that women could do many of these jobs instead and that they could replace male soldiers in offices, canteens, transport roles, stores and army bases. Many women volunteered to join the new Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) which later became known as the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps.\n WAAC volunteers wore green or 'khaki' uniforms like male soldiers. It included a small cap, khaki jacket and skirt. The skirt had to be no more than twelve inches from the ground. Women in the WAAC exercised every day, taking part in Morris dancing and hockey to keep fit.\n By the end of the war in 1918, more than 50,000 women had joined the WAAC, some working in war zones in France, Belgium, Italy and Greece. The volunteers did a variety of jobs.\n On the front line\n One of the jobs women did was to cook for men in camps and hospitals. Women looked after soldiers by cooking food and providing a waitress service. They cooked meals for the soldiers including savoury rice, stuffed tomatoes, rice croquettes, sea pie, curried cod, fish kedgeree (sic), fish cakes and liver and onions. They also made beef tea, mutton broth, brawn, potato pie and duff pudding. They sometimes served up food which is perhaps more familiar to us today such as stew and even curry! \n The food they cooked for men on the front line was often better quality than the food eaten by men back home. Men at war consumed an estimated 4,600 calories a day, compared with a working man's 3,400 a day at home. Women in the canteens were told to make the food feed as many men as possible so they used tricks to make their supplies go further, for example, they dipped rashers of bacon into flour or oatmeal to bulk them out. Other techniques women used included putting old bread in water and baking again in the oven for an hour.\n Many women were asked to undertake administrative tasks in the war offices. Women received 24 shillings for unskilled work but up to 48 shillings for jobs which required specific skills like shorthand or typing. \n After two years of service, a driver in the Army Service Corps received 10s/6d per week and a skilled fitter 12s/10d. As such a typist on 48 shillings (Â£2 and 8 shillings) was earning far more than some men. Women also answered telephones and passed on messages to soldiers.\n By 1916, some women had been given the task of repairing motor vehicles which had broken down. They worked with mechanics to identify what was wrong and learnt how to fix many problems themselves. They repaired trucks on the roadside and built new ones in factories. Women undertaking this type of work had been an unthinkable idea prior to the outbreak of war.\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at women's roles on the front line during World War One","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Find out what roles women carried out in the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps.","datetime":"1917-09-15 12:00:00 +0100"}
