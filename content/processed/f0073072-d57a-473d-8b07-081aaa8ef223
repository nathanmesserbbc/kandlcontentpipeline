If you have even a basic telescope, you don't necessarily need a high-tech camera to take beautiful photos of the night sky.\n * Video is the best way to look at bright planets. Cancel out any turbulence by 'stacking' the video frames taken by a webcam into a single image.\n * Gas giants Jupiter and Saturn are great targets for a compact camera connected to a telescope. The picture quality can be breath-taking.\n * Taking photos through a telescope with a digital SLR, then 'stacking' them with free software means you can produce pictures of nebulae without a tracking system.\n 0 - 1 : Take a closer look?","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Mark Thompson and LJ Rich show you how to take stunning photos of bright planets such as Jupiter and Saturn using a webcam connected to a telescope and some free computer software.","datetime":"7 8 and 9 January 2014"}
