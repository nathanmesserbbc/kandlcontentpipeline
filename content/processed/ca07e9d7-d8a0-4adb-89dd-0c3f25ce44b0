Its date appears to change unpredictably from year to year, and different branches of Christianity disagree on when exactly it should be marked. In some years, like 2014, western Christians and the Eastern churches (such as the Greek and Russian communities) celebrate Easter on the same Sunday â€“ but that is not always the case.\n It may seem strange that the Resurrection is not remembered on the same date across Christianity, and the reasons for this are intriguing. After the death of Jesus, Christian communities disagreed on the date it was said to have happened. Using the lunar calendar to determine its date added another layer of complexity, as there were various methods to calculate lunar cycles.\n Christians became real experts in the science of calculating the date of Easter year by year, known as 'computus'. It's no exaggeration to say that Easter played a key role in keeping maths and astronomy alive during the early middle ages. Groups across continents also used different Gospels to back up their traditions resulting in increasingly heated arguments.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":null,"description":"Why is Easter a movable feast, why there are two Easter dates and how Easter influenced the calendar we use today","datetime":"2013-05-05 12:00:00 +0100"}
