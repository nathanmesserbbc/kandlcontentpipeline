He led the first troops to France in 1914 and was in charge of the British Army on the Western Front, the main area of fighting in Europe, from 1915 until the war's end in 1918. \n The 'Old Contemptibles' \n The small army that went to France in 1914 was called the British Expeditionary Force or BEF. Haig's soldiers were later nicknamed the 'Old Contemptibles' because the German Kaiser (King) is supposed to have scornfully called them a 'contemptible (disgraceful) little army'.\n By 1918 there were five armies in the British Expeditionary Force. Haig had risen to the highest rank of all, Field Marshal, and was in command of them all. \n Haig was famous by the time World War One ended. He was praised for 'winning the war'. He helped set up the British Legion, to raise money to help ex-soldiers (sometimes known as veterans). Later, people disagreed about how good a leader he was and said Haig's battles cost too many soldiers' lives. \n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at 'Douglas Haig' during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Introduction to Douglas Haig and his life before, during and after World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
