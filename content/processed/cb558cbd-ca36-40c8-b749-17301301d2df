The start of war stopped workers striking as they now had to go and fight for Britain.\n The war caused some industries like ship building, steel factories and munitions to grow and they were able to offer employment to many people. This meant that skilled workers were as important to the war effort as those fighting at the front. When conscription was introduced in 1916, men who were needed in the factories were not conscripted (sent to fight).\n Other industries suffered because of the war, for example the cotton industry. In 1912 the textile industry reached its peak, producing billions of yards of cloth (an old measurement for length). After the outbreak of war in 1914 it became difficult to get raw materials to the cotton mills and to get the woven cotton to customers across the world. Other countries such as Japan began developing cotton industries of their own.\n Coal was essential to industry and was needed to run steam engines such as trains, make electricity, fire furnaces to make steel as well as heating people's homes. Before the war, there were thousands of miners working hard to dig enough coal to meet demand. Miners often went on strike to fight for better pay and to make the mines safer to work in. \n Coal mining was a dangerous job and it often seemed that the safety of the miners was not as important as making sure as much coal as possible was mined for the war effort. \n Strikes would not be welcome during the war so the government took over the mines in 1916, giving miners more pay and excusing them from conscription.\n* A pit pony would work an eight-hour shift each day, during which they might pull 30 tons of coal in tubs.\n * The ponies lived in stables in the mines and rarely came out into the daylight. \nPit ponies were small horses that would spend most of their lives underground, helping the miners by pulling carts full of coal. In 1913 there were thousands of pit ponies at work in Britain. When the government outlawed women and children pulling the tubs the next best thing was a pony. The men had their favourites and would often share their lunch with their pit pony. They appreciated the hard work that the ponies did.\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at men's roles on the home front during World War One.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The different types of industry roles men had during World War One","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
