We are ethical and moral and we have a compassion for people.\"\n Humanists are usually atheists, but can be agnostic. They do not look to a higher power for answers, but prefer to turn to science to understand the world around them. \n \"We take responsibility for our actions and base our ethics on the goals of human welfare, happiness and fulfilment,\" the Humanist Society Scotland says on its website.\n Humanism: 101\n* Humanists believe that human experience and rational thinking provide the only source of both knowledge and a moral code to live by\n * They reject the idea of knowledge 'revealed' to human beings by gods, or in special books\n * Most humanists think science provides the only reliable source of knowledge about the universe. And people can live ethical and fulfilling lives without religious beliefs\n * In 1952 at the first World Humanist Congress, the fundamentals of humanism were recorded in what the attendees described as the Amsterdam Declaration\n \"We seek to make the best of the one life we have by creating meaning and purpose for ourselves, individually and together.\"\n As in many Christian weddings, Mr Maguire meets with couples before performing their ceremony. While Christian couples may take part in pre-wedding workshops or receive informal guidance, couples married by Mr Maguire are each asked to write and talk about how they met and their hopes for the future.\n Miss McGoldrick, a property manager from Edinburgh particularly enjoyed this homework in preparation for her wedding to James Cherry.\n \"It reaffirms what you are doing and why, because you get so caught up in the planning and organising of the wedding, \" said Miss McGoldrick.\n \"To have that moment when you can take time out and actually go and reflect why you are doing it was brilliant and we both really enjoyed it and found it invaluable.\"\n Know your wedding rituals\n* At a Jewish wedding, it is traditional for the bride and groom to fast on the day of the wedding, to cleanse themselves of sin and come to their marriage with a clean slate\n * There are a number of rituals at a Hindu wedding. The bride's parents welcome the bridegroom and his family at the boundary of the house where the wedding is taking place. A red kum-kum (kind of powder) mark is applied to their forehead\n * There are two types of Catholic wedding ceremony. One is with Mass and one without. The former celebrates the Eucharist and lasts for about an hour. During this service gifts are presented and the altar is prepared, then the Eucharist prayer is said\n Ged McFarlane a maintenance officer from Motherwell and his partner, Jane Brown chose a Humanist wedding as they were not able to get married in his local Catholic chapel. As Miss Brown had been married before, they were refused.\n In the Catholic church, a marriage is a divine institution and can never be broken, even if the partners are legally divorced. As long as they are both alive, the Church considers them bound together by God and therefore will not marry divorcees, apart from in exceptional circumstances.\n Couples organising Humanist wedding ceremonies can choose to part with tradition or fully embrace it. Some brides choose to be walked down the aisle by their fathers, or both parents, or make that walk on their own. \n And there is a greater choice in terms of location than there is for civil ceremonies which have to be conducted at premises with licences.\n A humanist wedding can be conducted by a celebrant in any 'safe and dignified' location.\n Mr Maguire has married couples in working churches, but also beside picturesque lochs.\n In a civil ceremony couples are able to adapt their vows. Whereas Humanist Society Scotland celebrants encourage couples to write their own personal wedding service. \n Many couples choose to include Handfasting, a pagan tradition involving a symbolic act where the couple's hands are bound together, usually by ribbons or cord. Mr Maguire conducted a ceremony on a mountaintop for two avid climbers, they used climbing rope for the handfasting.\n Wherever the location of the ceremony, and regardless of what special traditions are involved, Mr Maguire thinks there is something much more unique about a humanist wedding ceremony.\n \"What's really interesting is when people say in their own words why they love one another and what they hope to achieve. And that is incredibly moving, and that's wherever it takes place, whether that is in your back garden or a fabulous castle.\" he said.\n Couples all over the UK should be able to have a humanist ceremony as a legally recognised service believes Isabel Russo, Head of Ceremonies at the BHA.\n \"There's an obvious unfairness in a law which allows everyone to have a civil marriage but allows only religious couples to have legal recognition for the ceremony based on their fundamental values and beliefs.\" \n A recent attempt to have an amendment (to recognise humanist marriages) to the Marriage Bill, before the UK parliament, was rejected. \n Big day food inspiration\n How about a refreshing Pimms Lollies?\n Not a fan of fruit cake? How about making three-tier red velvet cake for your guests?\n How about raising a toast with a glass of Rose prosecco cocktail?\n But the BHA continue to campaign, their Chief Executive, Andrew Copson told the BBC.\n \"The amendment will be brought back again and the British Humanist Association hopes that it will succeed and that government will support legal recognition (to humanist marriages).\" \n Meanwhile, recent marriage figures from the Registrar General show over half of the 29,135 weddings in Scotland in 2011 were civil ceremonies.\n There were 5,557 marriages carried out by Church of Scotland ministers, 2,486 Humanist marriages and 1,729 Catholic marriages.\n The Church of Scotland says its doors are open to all couples wanting to wed, including those who are not members of their congregation, and people of all beliefs and none. \n The Church of Scotland's Reverend Sally Foster-Fulton says: \"The Church believes that the vows and commitments of a marriage ceremony are the best foundation for a life-long relationship whatever the nature of the ceremony that blesses them and it celebrates the fact that marriages are on the increase.\"","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"Humanist wedding ceremonies are on the rise in Scotland, so why are so many couples choosing this option instead of a traditional church service?","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
