However, after 1916, official photographers were appointed by the army to take photographs and moving film on the front line. Many still exist today. \n One particular camera which was small enough for photographers to keep with them was the Kodak Vest Pocket Camera (seen above with its case). \n There was also a special type of photographic viewer called a stereoscope. This allowed someone to place a picture inside and see it in 3D when they looked through the lens. \n Bird's eye view\n Photographs were taken by the Royal Flying Corps and allowed the army to spy on the Germans and make maps of their trenches. They could also create maps of the front line. With these maps, they planned where and how to attack.\n A man called William Sansome Tucker invented the hot-wire microphone. This could identify the sound of a shell and helped troops to work out where the shell had been fired from. They could then get into the best position to avoid injury. \n In April 1916, the hydrophone discovered its first ever German U-boat. With this, the user could hear sounds under water and find out how far away U-boats (submarines) were. Later in the war, the Americans invented a super-powerful hydrophone which could detect U-boats as far as 25 miles away because they could hear their propellers.\n Teachers' notes\n Teachers' notes and classroom ideas looking at technology, communications and weapons.","feed":null,"feeds":null,"favicon":"http://www.bbc.co.uk/favicon.ico","description":"The development of sound and photography during World War One.","datetime":"2011-10-07 12:00:00 +0100"}
